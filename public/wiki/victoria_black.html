<ul><li>Personality &amp; Role: Emotion-driven, charming, and persuasive. Prefers solving conflict with presence and wit rather than fists.</li>
<li>Combat Style: Pure **blaster**—precision beams and large-scale orbs; limited early CQC skill.</li>

<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Harmony" title="Harmony">Harmony</a> is the permanent spirit fusion of <a href="/wiki/Victoria_Chaser" title="Victoria Chaser">Victoria Chaser</a>, Victoria Black, and <a href="/wiki/Wargirl" title="Wargirl">Wargirl</a> anchored into a chosen girl (5'2”, ~120 lb, Black’s complexion).</li>
<li>Philosophy split on training:
<ul><li>**Chaser:** strength is earned through harsh training and difficult fights.</li>
<li>**Black:** protect Harmony first; power-level her quickly (often via Wargirl) to keep her safe.</li></ul></li></ul>
<h2><span id=".E2.80.9CHarmony.E2.80.9D_Incident"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="“Harmony”_Incident">“Harmony” Incident</span></h2>
<ul><li>Setup: Harmony’s first big match is against fusion titans <span class="new" title="Vegito (page does not exist)" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvVmVnaXRvP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==">Vegito</span> and <span class="new" title="Gogeta (page does not exist)" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvR29nZXRhP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==">Gogeta</span>. She holds her own but is being pushed back.</li>
<li>Black’s Leap: Unable to watch Harmony struggle, **Black jumps in**, shouting: “<i>Pick on someone your own size!</i>”</li></ul>
<pre> Being a blaster with no CQC, she’s **dominated** in a one-sided beating.
</pre>
<ul><li>Harmony’s Plea: In tears, Harmony **begs to sub in for her mother**—not out of pride, but to stop the beating.</li>
<li>Chaser’s Protective Fury:
<ul><li>Chaser is **enraged for her sister**, not at her. She enters in **Base** and begins winning immediately.</li>
<li>Black stirs, weakly jokes, “<i>Oh… look who finally made it…</i>”</li>
<li>The line breaks Chaser; rage mixes with guilt. Whispering, “<i>You shouldn’t have had to feel alone out here… I’m sorry, Black,</i>” she erupts **Super Saiyan** and **one-sides** the opponent (even after a 100% <span class="new" title="Frieza (page does not exist)" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvRnJpZXphP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==">Frieza</span> escalation).</li></ul></li>
<li>Aftermath: Chaser carries Black off; Harmony finishes weaker opponents. The event cements their dynamic: Chaser finally understands Black’s depth of love; Black sees Chaser’s love made manifest.</li></ul>
<h2><span id="Desire_for_Control_.28Emotional_Pivot.29"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Desire_for_Control_(Emotional_Pivot)">Desire for Control (Emotional Pivot)</span></h2>
<p>Humiliated and shaken, Black vows never to be helpless again. Two obsessions take root:
</p>
<ul><li>**Control:** having someone act on her commands without hesitation.</li>
<li>**Power:** becoming a blaster so strong no one threatens her or Harmony.</li></ul>
<h2><span id="The_Vegeta_Challenge_.28Birth_of_Binary.29"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Vegeta_Challenge_(Birth_of_Binary)">The Vegeta Challenge (Birth of Binary)</span></h2>
<ul><li>Black doesn’t beg <span class="new" title="Vegeta (page does not exist)" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvVmVnZXRhP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==">Vegeta</span>—she **“womaned”** him: “<i>If I beat you, you’ll show me how you broke past your limits.</i>”</li>
<li>Pride snared, Vegeta trains her brutally. After several rounds and an earned win, training intensifies in the wastes.</li>
<li>Result: **Warrior Victoria** is born—real combat skill added to her ranged dominance.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>First Emergence – Vegeta Training</b>: Pushed past her limits, Black triggers a catastrophic **Final Explosion** and first becomes **<a href="/wiki/Binary" title="Binary">Binary</a>** (pre-separation).</li>
<li><b>Second Use – Harasser Fight</b>: During the “jerks in the lobby” period, Black calls Binary in a public fight. **Binary loses**—overwhelming power but poor battle discipline (too many poses/one-liners, not enough fundamentals). This publicly exposes Binary’s flaw: <b>power ≠ experience</b>.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Context (from the description): As a team competition with **Brother Kai (@Yaboi354)** nears, Harmony and Chaser strategize while Black relaxes, trying to set up photos at **Kami House**.</li>
<li>A harasser in the lobby **catcalls and harasses** Black; pre-competition skirmishes ensue.</li>

<li>By Saiyan honor, **Turles agrees to empower Chaser** (dark Tree-of-Might fruit–based power-up).</li>
<li>During tense exchanges, Chaser **mentions Binary’s flaw** (immense power, little battle experience). Turles sees a second opportunity: trigger Binary and **exploit** it.</li>
<li>The Plan: Stage a convincing “betrayal” fight, draw Turles to the house, and provoke Black into Binary.</li></ul>

She fought with pride and loyalty, supporting <a href="/wiki/Harmony" title="Harmony">Harmony</a> as a true sister and obeying anything Victoria Black asked of her. 
</p><p>During this period, Victoria Black began to see Wargirl in a different light. Aside from Wargirl’s powerful body and striking beauty, what attracted Black most was her protective heart and steadfast loyalty. She was like the perfect partner — strong, supportive, devoted — only without the intimacy… at first.  
</p><p>Black, however, grew increasingly lonely. She dressed seductively, but without a partner, her hunger only grew. Every hug, every touch from Wargirl left her shaken. As her depression deepened, she began playing manipulative games, pretending to open up about what was wrong only to pull back. This drove Wargirl’s caring nature to the breaking point.  
</p><p>One night, as Black quietly cried just loud enough to be heard, Wargirl confronted her. Cornered, Victoria whispered through her tears:  
</p>
<dl><dd><i>“I just… I just really need someone right now but…”</i></dd></dl>
<p>When Wargirl demanded to know who, Victoria met her eyes and confessed:  
</p>
<dl><dd><i>“I… I need you.”</i></dd></dl>
<p>She pulled Wargirl into a trembling kiss. Though shocked, Wargirl could not resist when Black, at her most vulnerable, begged her to stay.  
</p><p>The tension broke. Wargirl gave in, kissing her back with passion built up over years. Black then slowly opened her legs,  whispering her loneliness, her despair, and her desire to feel good again. Slowly, she guided Wargirl down, pleading:  
</p>
<dl><dd><i>“Please… do I even deserve to feel good at all?”</i></dd></dl>
<p>Wargirl understood and gave her what she needed. For the first time in years, Black let go, overwhelmed to the point of passing out. Wargirl carried her to bed and sat at the foot of it, shaken by the weight of what had just happened, before falling asleep herself.  
</p><p><b>Significance:</b>
</p>
<ul><li>This event explains why Victoria Black never seeks men for intimacy — Wargirl satisfies her needs.</li>
<li>It begins a secret relationship where Wargirl becomes Black’s source of release and comfort.</li>

Wargirl always came—understanding, compassionate, and ready to give Black whatever she needed.
</p>
<dl><dt>A seeming “perfect” life</dt></dl>

</p><p>Because so many of the Time Patrollers and strongest Saiyans' children passed through <strong class="mw-selflink selflink">Victoria Black</strong>’s classroom at some point in the day, word spread fast. Many parents came to offer their condolences and comfort her.

Known for her questionable gifts, she had chosen a dress that was nearly identical to one SHE already wears! — yet Victoria was genuinely grateful.
</p><p>This is how Victoria obtained the <b>Supreme Kai of Time Dress.</b> Typical of her bold style, she ignored the dress’s pants and wore it alone, bare underneath except for dazzling gold heels and matching gold undergarments. The center slit of the dress was very high, so the gold accents were often visible when she walked. She wore her hair in an elegant updo during this time.
</p><p>Many of the other Kais disapproved of her revealing take on their sacred garment — but none dared confront her. If this style helped Victoria heal from the loss of her twin, so be it.
