Black – The Alluring Twin of Victoria Chaser</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Victoria Black</strong> is one of the three original sisters
and the seductive, emotionally driven twin of <strong>Victoria
Chaser</strong>. Known for her striking beauty, manipulative charm, and
immense power, Victoria Black plays a central role in the Xenoverse. She
is both a fierce warrior and a figure of desire, often using her
presence and appeal to disarm or control others.</p>
<p>Her evolution eventually leads to the creation of her unleashed alter
ego, <strong>Binary</strong>.</p>

(Pre-Separation Lore)</h1>
<p><em>Victoria Black</em> is a long-range blaster specialist and the
twin sister of <a href="Victoria_Chaser.html">Victoria Chaser</a> and
elder sister of <a href="Wargirl.html">Wargirl</a>. She is known for
dazzling charisma, a teacher’s calm, and devastating ranged ki—while

<li>Personality &amp; Role: Emotion-driven, charming, and persuasive.

<h2 id="harmonys_creation">Harmony’s Creation</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="Harmony.html">Harmony</a> is the permanent spirit fusion of
<a href="Victoria_Chaser.html">Victoria Chaser</a>, Victoria Black, and
<a href="Wargirl.html">Wargirl</a> anchored into a chosen girl (5'2”,
~120 lb, Black’s complexion).</li>
<li>Philosophy split on training:
<ul>
<li>**Chaser:** strength is earned through harsh training and difficult
fights.</li>
<li>**Black:** protect Harmony first; power-level her quickly (often via
Wargirl) to keep her safe.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="harmony_incident">“Harmony” Incident</h2>
<ul>
<li>Setup: Harmony’s first big match is against fusion titans
<a href="Vegito.html">Vegito</a> and <a href="Gogeta.html">Gogeta</a>.
She holds her own but is being pushed back.</li>
<li>Black’s Leap: Unable to watch Harmony struggle, **Black jumps in**,
shouting: “<em>Pick on someone your own size!</em>”</li>
</ul>
<p><code> Being a blaster with no CQC, she’s **dominated** in a one-sided beating.</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Harmony’s Plea: In tears, Harmony **begs to sub in for her
mother**—not out of pride, but to stop the beating.</li>
<li>Chaser’s Protective Fury:
<ul>
<li>Chaser is **enraged for her sister**, not at her. She enters in
**Base** and begins winning immediately.</li>
<li>Black stirs, weakly jokes, “<em>Oh… look who finally made
it…</em>”</li>
<li>The line breaks Chaser; rage mixes with guilt. Whispering, “<em>You
shouldn’t have had to feel alone out here… I’m sorry, Black,</em>” she
erupts **Super Saiyan** and **one-sides** the opponent (even after a
100% <a href="Frieza.html">Frieza</a> escalation).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Aftermath: Chaser carries Black off; Harmony finishes weaker
opponents. The event cements their dynamic: Chaser finally understands
Black’s depth of love; Black sees Chaser’s love made manifest.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="desire_for_control_emotional_pivot">Desire for Control
(Emotional Pivot)</h2>
<p>Humiliated and shaken, Black vows never to be helpless again. Two
obsessions take root:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Control:** having someone act on her commands without
hesitation.</li>
<li>**Power:** becoming a blaster so strong no one threatens her or
Harmony.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the_vegeta_challenge_birth_of_binary">The Vegeta Challenge
(Birth of Binary)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Black doesn’t beg <a href="Vegeta.html">Vegeta</a>—she **“womaned”**
him: “<em>If I beat you, you’ll show me how you broke past your
limits.</em>”</li>
<li>Pride snared, Vegeta trains her brutally. After several rounds and
an earned win, training intensifies in the wastes.</li>
<li>Result: **Warrior Victoria** is born—real combat skill added to her
ranged dominance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="binarys_earliest_uses_pre_separation">Binary’s Earliest Uses
(Pre-Separation)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>First Emergence – Vegeta Training</strong>: Pushed past her
limits, Black triggers a catastrophic **Final Explosion** and first
becomes **<a href="Binary.html">Binary</a>** (pre-separation).</li>
<li><strong>Second Use – Harasser Fight</strong>: During the “jerks in
the lobby” period, Black calls Binary in a public fight. **Binary
loses**—overwhelming power but poor battle discipline (too many
poses/one-liners, not enough fundamentals). This publicly exposes
Binary’s flaw: <strong>power ≠ experience</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="jerks_in_the_lobby_harassment_incident">“Jerks in the Lobby”
Harassment Incident</h2>
<ul>
<li>Context (from the description): As a team competition with **Brother
Kai (@Yaboi354)** nears, Harmony and Chaser strategize while Black
relaxes, trying to set up photos at **Kami House**.</li>
<li>A harasser in the lobby **catcalls and harasses** Black;
pre-competition skirmishes ensue.</li>
<li>With <a href="Jiren.html">Jiren</a>, Pride Troopers, and
<a href="Hit.html">Hit</a> unavailable, Black improvises; eventually
**Chaser barely defeats the harasser** and defends Black’s honor.</li>
<li>Takeaway: Chaser concludes she must grow even stronger—but not via
the Goku/Vegeta paths. She begins seeking a darker solution.</li>
</ul>
<h2
id="the_turles_deception_chasers_jealous_gamble_to_protect_the_family">The
Turles Deception (Chaser’s Jealous Gamble to Protect the Family)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chaser, shaken by the lobby incident and protective of the family
(while also jealous of Black’s status), secretly meets
<a href="Turles.html">Turles</a>.</li>
<li>By Saiyan honor, **Turles agrees to empower Chaser** (dark
Tree-of-Might fruit–based power-up).</li>
<li>During tense exchanges, Chaser **mentions Binary’s flaw** (immense
power, little battle experience). Turles sees a second opportunity:
trigger Binary and **exploit** it.</li>
<li>The Plan: Stage a convincing “betrayal” fight, draw Turles to the
house, and provoke Black into Binary.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the_battle_at_the_house_binarys_third_appearance">The Battle at
the House (Binary’s Third Appearance)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Black senses Turles at her home; Chaser’s ki is erratic. She
confronts him at the door.</li>
<li>Triggered, Black detonates a massive **Final Explosion**; **Binary**
emerges—devastating but still undisciplined.</li>
<li>Turles **defeats Binary** and, while she’s unconscious, **drains
part of her Binary energy**.</li>
</ul>

<dt></dt>
<dd>
The description phrases it as a “crystal” extraction; canonically, it is
a **personal assault** via direct contact.
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Binary collapses back to Victoria Black. Turles departs.</li>
<li>Later, true to his word, Turles **does** empower Chaser fully—mixing
stolen Binary energy into a potion.</li>

Wish (Setup for the Ambush)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Seeking control and validation, Black uses the Dragon Balls: “<em>I

<li>The Eternal Dragon grants—but **punishes** the selfish wish: the
man, **<a href="Pharaoh_Gogeta.html">Pharaoh Gogeta</a>**, is created

<h2 id="the_ambush_on_turles_recovery_of_binarys_power_turles_death">The
Ambush on Turles (Recovery of Binary’s Power; Turles’ Death)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Instead of going herself, Black sends **Wargirl, Harmony, and
Natsuko** to retrieve Pharaoh Gogeta.</li>
<li>On that search, Harmony senses **Turles** nearby—and sees a jar
literally labeled **“Binary’s Energy.”**</li>
<li>The trio ambushes Turles:
<ul>
<li>Harmony opens with blaster tech;</li>
<li>Wargirl crashes through his guard;</li>
<li>Natsuko locks down space with suppression.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The jar is shattered; the **stolen Binary energy is
reclaimed**.</li>
<li>Turles returns to their house demanding the stolen power back</li>

<h2 id="the_forbidden_bond_with_wargirl">The Forbidden Bond with
Wargirl</h2>
<p>With <a href="Turles.html">Turles</a> dead and
<a href="Victoria_Chaser.html">Victoria Chaser</a> retiring to focus on
her career as an attorney, <a href="Wargirl.html">Wargirl</a> stepped
into the role of main PvP fighter. She fought with pride and loyalty,
supporting <a href="Harmony.html">Harmony</a> as a true sister and
obeying anything Victoria Black asked of her.</p>
<p>During this period, Victoria Black began to see Wargirl in a
different light. Aside from Wargirl’s powerful body and striking beauty,
what attracted Black most was her protective heart and steadfast
loyalty. She was like the perfect partner — strong, supportive, devoted
— only without the intimacy… at first.</p>
<p>Black, however, grew increasingly lonely. She dressed seductively,
but without a partner, her hunger only grew. Every hug, every touch from
Wargirl left her shaken. As her depression deepened, she began playing
manipulative games, pretending to open up about what was wrong only to
pull back. This drove Wargirl’s caring nature to the breaking point.</p>
<p>One night, as Black quietly cried just loud enough to be heard,
Wargirl confronted her. Cornered, Victoria whispered through her
tears:</p>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
<em>“I just… I just really need someone right now but…”</em>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When Wargirl demanded to know who, Victoria met her eyes and
confessed:</p>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
<em>“I… I need you.”</em>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>She pulled Wargirl into a trembling kiss. Though shocked, Wargirl
could not resist when Black, at her most vulnerable, begged her to
stay.</p>
<p>The tension broke. Wargirl gave in, kissing her back with passion
built up over years. Black then slowly opened her legs, whispering her
loneliness, her despair, and her desire to feel good again. Slowly, she
guided Wargirl down, pleading:</p>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
<em>“Please… do I even deserve to feel good at all?”</em>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Wargirl understood and gave her what she needed. For the first time
in years, Black let go, overwhelmed to the point of passing out. Wargirl
carried her to bed and sat at the foot of it, shaken by the weight of
what had just happened, before falling asleep herself.</p>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This event explains why Victoria Black never seeks men for intimacy
— Wargirl satisfies her needs.</li>
<li>It begins a secret relationship where Wargirl becomes Black’s source
of release and comfort.</li>
<li>It creates a dangerous tension with
<a href="Veronica_Jones.html">Veronica Jones</a>’ future goals, as
Black’s claim on Wargirl snowballs into a central conflict.</li>

The Fall of Victoria Black’s Calm — The Gas Mask Kidnapping Prelude</h2>
<p>In the months after <a href="Turles.html">Turles</a>’ death,
<strong>Victoria Black</strong> found a fragile balance. She focused on
her work as a teacher at <a href="Orange_Star_High_School.html">Orange
Star High School</a> and on raising <a href="Harmony.html">Harmony</a>,
while <a href="Wargirl.html">Wargirl</a> stepped forward as the family’s
primary PvP fighter. Whenever Black felt the sting of
<a href="Victoria_Chaser.html">Victoria Chaser</a>’s growing distance,
she quietly called on Wargirl for comfort. Wargirl always
came—understanding, compassionate, and ready to give Black whatever she
needed.</p>
<dl>
<dt>A seeming “perfect” life</dt>

</dl>
<ul>
<li>Black wasn’t the frontline fighter anymore; others handled the
battles she once dreaded.</li>
<li>Her requests were followed, her careers were stable, and Harmony was
thriving—making friends with <a href="Goten.html">Goten</a> and
<a href="Kid_Trunks.html">Kid Trunks</a>.</li>
<li>Wargirl defended the family’s honor in PvP, letting Black believe
she had finally arranged the world the way she wanted.</li>

<dt>A new fear</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>As Black’s care for Wargirl deepened (as sister and secret lover),
worry took root. Wargirl fought decisively for good and began attracting
dangerous enemies.</li>
<li>Foes would double- and triple-team her, cheat to beat her, and—most
terrifying—**bodychangers** coveted Wargirl’s powerful, beautiful
body.</li>
<li>Black urged Wargirl to hire protection. Wargirl disliked the idea
but complied; the candidates didn’t last.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the_zamasu_bargain_immortality_the_shadow">The Zamasu Bargain
(Immortality &amp; the Shadow)</h3>
<p>Desperate to ensure she could always protect Wargirl, Black sought
<a href="Merged_Zamasu.html">Merged Zamasu</a> and pleaded for
immortality. Zamasu agreed—at the price of Black’s servitude if he ever
called upon it. To seal the pact, he pulled a shadow from her soul and
created **Evil Victoria**:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Evil Victoria</strong>: a darker stand-in for Victoria
Black—same face, same presence, capable of fighting in her place and
even accessing <a href="Binary.html">Binary</a>.</li>
<li>With no dedicated purpose beyond service, Evil Victoria acted when
Black needed a proxy or when Zamasu willed it.</li>

<h3 id="evil_victorias_early_matches">Evil Victoria’s Early Matches</h3>
<p>While <a href="Wargirl.html">Wargirl</a> worked a shift at the Conton

hard and—via mental link—threatened she would escalate to Binary if

<p>The next day, Wargirl didn’t arrive home from work—she had been

screamed the truth. She set out immediately.</li>
<li>Seeking help from <a href="Ken.html">Ken</a> (ally of

<p>While Black searched, Harmony engaged one of the kidnappers.

remained.</p>

<li>Victoria was relieved to save Harmony but devastated to lose

<h3 id="weeks_of_frustration_support_at_home">Weeks of Frustration &amp;

<p>A lead surfaced: a top henchman of the Gas Master promised Wargirl’s

nothing.</p>

**<a href="FlashDancer.html">FlashDancer</a>** (Black’s cousin) and

<p>After the destruction of the Gas Mask Clan and the death of
<a href="Victoria_Chaser.html">Victoria Chaser</a>, news of the tragedy
spread quickly through Conton City. <a href="Goten.html">Goten</a> and
<a href="Kid_Trunks.html">Kid Trunks</a> told their fathers what had
happened during the mission, and soon <a href="Goku.html">Goku</a> and
<a href="Gohan.html">Gohan</a> knew the full story.</p>
<p>Because so many of the Time Patrollers and strongest Saiyans'
children passed through <a href="Victoria_Black.html">Victoria
Black</a>’s classroom at some point in the day, word spread fast. Many
parents came to offer their condolences and comfort her.</p>
<h3 id="a_visit_from_goku_and_gohan">A Visit from Goku and Gohan</h3>
<p>Grief consumed Victoria for weeks. Seeing her sinking,
<a href="Goku.html">Goku</a> decided to visit her. He thought the best
way to lift her spirits would be sparring. It was the last thing on her
mind, but <a href="Wargirl.html">Wargirl</a> encouraged her to go,
teasing that her tongue was getting tired from comforting her so
much.</p>
<p>Reluctantly, Victoria agreed. To her surprise, sparring with Goku and
<a href="Gohan.html">Gohan</a> actually helped distract her from the
grief for a while. The first few rounds went well, and she began to feel
herself again, if only briefly.</p>
<h3 id="the_supreme_kai_of_times_gift">The Supreme Kai of Time’s
Gift</h3>
<p>Wanting to add a woman’s touch to her healing, the
<a href="Supreme_Kai_of_Time.html">Supreme Kai of Time</a> visited
Victoria personally, bringing her a “gift”: a new dress. Known for her
questionable gifts, she had chosen a dress that was nearly identical to
one SHE already wears! — yet Victoria was genuinely grateful.</p>
<p>This is how Victoria obtained the <strong>Supreme Kai of Time
Dress.</strong> Typical of her bold style, she ignored the dress’s pants
and wore it alone, bare underneath except for dazzling gold heels and
matching gold undergarments. The center slit of the dress was very high,
so the gold accents were often visible when she walked. She wore her
