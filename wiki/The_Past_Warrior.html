<h1>The Past Warrior</h1>
<h2 id="appearance">Appearance</h2>
<p>The Past Warrior is an ancient Saiyan locked in his Super Saiyan 3
state. He has long golden spiked hair that flows past his shoulders, a
thick beard, and a serious, battle-worn expression. His outfit consists
of dark warrior armor with shoulder plates, a tan scarf, leather gloves,
and a utility belt with pouches. He carries a sword across his back, a
constant reminder of his warrior lineage.</p>
<h2 id="personality">Personality</h2>
<p>Stoic and disciplined, The Past Warrior represents the lost age of
Saiyan honor. Unlike modern Saiyans, his demeanor is somber, with a deep
sense of responsibility for protecting those around him. He speaks
little but commands respect through his presence and power.</p>
<h2 id="powers_and_abilities">Powers and Abilities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ancient Super Saiyan 3</strong> – Permanently maintains
SSJ3, having mastered the form beyond modern Saiyans. His stamina drain
is nearly nonexistent compared to current generations.</li>
<li><strong>Warrior’s Blade</strong> – A heavy sword strapped to his
back. Though rarely used, when drawn it channels his ki to cut through
magical and ki-based defenses.</li>
<li><strong>Saiyan Heritage</strong> – Possesses amplified strength,
durability, and battle sense inherited from the ancient Saiyans, making
him a formidable strategist as well as a fighter.</li>
<li><strong>Temporal Resilience</strong> – As a being pulled from the
past, his ki reacts differently to time-based attacks, granting partial
resistance to distortions and manipulations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The Past Warrior is believed to be a displaced alternate version of
Drakor, brought forward from a forgotten era of Saiyan battles. His
survival into the present day suggests powerful temporal interference or
deliberate summoning.</p>
