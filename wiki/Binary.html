<h1>Binary</h1>
<p><img src="../images/Full_Power_Binary.png" alt="Full_Power_Binary"/></p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Binary</strong> is the nuclear-powered evolved form and
“other half” of <a href="Victoria_Black.html">Victoria Black</a>,
created when Victoria pushed beyond her limits with
<a href="Vegeta.html">Vegeta</a>’s help. Her separation occurred when
<a href="Merged_Zamasu.html">Merged Zamasu</a> was persuaded to help
extract the unstable energy from Victoria Black, resulting in Binary
being born as her own being.</p>
<p>Unlike her origin-self, Binary is mean, aggressive, and thrives on
destruction. Now that she’s her own entity she really wants to align
with evil. She fears only one thing: <a href="Harmony.html">Harmony</a>
tattling on her to their mother. She is still young minded even though
she’s older than Harmony. As such, she is bound by her strict respect
for and obedience to her mother. Basically she can’t practice being evil
while her family is around. She is far more powerful than Harmony, but
envies her emotional bonds.</p>
<p>Binary operates independently and is considered one of the most
dangerous entities in the universe. She uses very large all area
attacks, able to generate planet-sized nuclear, atomic or Hakai fused
blasts. She is easily the family’s goto for desperate times or when all
else fails , provided you can convince her. Although as independent,
Binary has gained some fighters experience, she is still considered the
weakest in the family in that department, much lower than her sister
Harmony.</p>
<p>Binary as a young woman, realized that she wants to be submissive in
the relationship sense, while being very much dominant in the
fighting/blasting sense. She will laugh at you as you begin to
deteriorate from her blasts, but then suddenly imagine you mounting her
helpless body. This in itself is not the most feasible due to the fact
that she stands at 5’8 with really big legs and rear and really wide ,
attention grabbing wings. She assumes she scares off most men. Of
course, she would be wrong, but that’s her crazy mind.</p>
<h2 id="appearance">Appearance</h2>
<p>Binary has a striking and intimidating design:</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="lore">Lore</h2>
<p>On average, when <a href="Victoria_Black.html">Victoria Black</a>
undergoes her explosive evolving process, the nuclear energy that
becomes <strong>Binary</strong> is created. Normally, Binary immediately
absorbs Victoria’s energy, making her even stronger. This state remains
until Binary is “finished” and reverts back into Victoria.</p>
<p>The key problem was that, unlike other fusions such as
<a href="Vegito.html">Vegito</a>, who know and accept that their
existence will eventually end, Binary does not understand this. She does
not want to revert. Once she exists, Binary WANTS to exist. She cares
very little about missions or goals — her priority is simply continuing
her own existence.</p>
<h3 id="a_day_of_normal_living">A Day of Normal Living</h3>
<p>Wanting to show kindness as a mother, Victoria Black once wished to
the Dragon to let Binary live one full day as a normal mortal Saiyan.
The Dragon granted it, stripping Binary of her immortality, destructive
powers, angel wings, and glowing aura. While Binary was free, Victoria
remained unconscious, leaving her body guarded by
<a href="Vanessa.html">Vanessa</a> and <a href="Kai.html">Kai</a> while
<a href="Harmony.html">Harmony</a> escorted Binary through Conton
City.</p>
<p>Binary’s mortal day began awkwardly — she explored daily life with
curiosity while her protectors watched over her. She quietly remembered
things she had never had time to notice: food, music, casual laughter,
and even the warm chaos of the Time Patroller marketplace.</p>
<p>However, tension rose when she was introduced to
<a href="Turles.html">Turles</a>, who had been tasked by
<a href="Mira.html">Mira</a> to protect her during this fragile day.
Binary was not afraid of Turles, but deeply unsettled. She remembered
how, when she was younger and inexperienced, Turles had stolen her power
in a very personal and invasive way while she was unconscious. She also
vividly remembered killing him herself with her devastating Core Breaker
attack. To see him alive and well was disorienting — and even more so
knowing Mira trusted him to protect her now.</p>
<p>Despite her anxiety, Turles kept his word and protected her until he
was ultimately defeated. Binary, torn between anger and responsibility,
hesitantly restored him — even as flashbacks flooded her mind.
Ironically, this may be the seed of her later post-separation
infatuation with Turles: he was the only man who had ever been
“intimate” with her in any sense, and the contradiction lingered in her
heart.</p>
<p>Later that day, <a href="Broly.html">Broly</a> and his team appeared,
threatening everything. A fierce team battle erupted. Mortal Binary was
vastly outclassed and could not harm Broly, but she used clever
distractions to pull him away from her teammate just long enough for
that teammate to power up and revive their fallen ally. When Binary’s
luck ran out and Broly nearly killed her — which could have meant the
end of Victoria Black as well — her teammate struck Broly from behind
just in time, stopping the killing blow. They then shouted for Binary to
run. Lacking her usual flight abilities, she obeyed and sprinted away to
safety as the team finished the fight without her.</p>
<p>After Broly’s defeat, Binary shared a warm, uplifting moment with
<a href="Goku.html">Goku</a> and <a href="Uub.html">Uub</a>, basking in
the simple joy of being treated as just another fighter instead of a
living weapon. Soon after, her mortal time ended, and she faded back
into Victoria Black, carrying with her the bittersweet memory of being
truly alive for a day.</p>
<h3 id="the_separation">The Separation</h3>
<p>The gesture had beautiful intentions but dire consequences. Binary
cherished the day deeply, and when she returned, the little memories of
her “day out” began flooding Victoria’s mind. Suddenly Victoria could
not sleep, focus, or even meditate — Binary’s thoughts were constantly
whispering in her head. Harmony, who could communicate with her mother
telepathically, sensed how serious the situation was becoming. Binary’s
desire for independence, even when sealed back within Victoria, was
destabilizing Victoria’s mind. Harmony realized this could not continue
— if nothing was done, Binary would eventually consume her mother
completely.</p>
<p>Harmony proposed that if Binary could be isolated before she absorbed
Victoria, both could continue existing — but independently. Victoria,
desperate to preserve her own identity and protect her daughter, sought
help from <a href="Merged_Zamasu.html">Merged Zamasu</a>. By convincing
him that “two slaves were better than one,” she persuaded Zamasu to
enter the explosion of her evolution and extract Binary’s unstable
energy before it overtook her.</p>
<p>Zamasu succeeded. At the peak of the explosion, he ripped Binary free
before she could fully absorb Victoria. As the dust cleared, Binary
remained unconscious but alive, and Victoria was restored. Though the
mission was successful, Zamasu reminded Victoria of her debt to him
before vanishing. The sisters and allies brought Binary home, shocked to
finally see the being that had haunted Victoria’s dreams — now a living
person.</p>
<p>From that point on, Binary was no longer just an energy form. She was
her own being: powerful, destructive, jealous, and deeply hungry to
continue existing.</p>
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Victoria Black</strong>: Her “mother” and original self.
Binary embodies Victoria’s lust, wrath, and power without her
compassion.</li>
<li><strong>Harmony</strong>: Binary’s younger “sister,” whom she fears
only because of Harmony’s ability to tattle to Victoria. She resents
Harmony’s innocence.</li>
<li><strong>Victoria Chaser</strong>: Deceased aunt; Binary unleashed
mass destruction after her death.</li>
<li><strong>Wargirl</strong>: Younger aunt. They share a rivalry in
strength but rarely cooperate.</li>
<li><strong>Vanessa</strong>: Ally who helped her annihilate the Gas
Mask Clan’s planet.</li>
<li><strong>Turles</strong>: Object of her crush. She becomes openly
flirtatious and bold around him.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="trivia">Trivia</h2>
<ul>
<li>Binary’s hair and boots are always sparkling.</li>
<li>She is often seen wearing a zipped purple tracksuit when not in
combat.</li>
<li>Her eyes have no visible pupils and glow red when charging
attacks.</li>
<li>She fears emotional vulnerability and refuses to admit she wants
affection.</li>
<li>She's so used causing fear and intimidating folks. Binary secretly
watching SSJ3 Wargirl become physically aggressive and uncontrollably
dominant while chasing her climax on top of a male partner. <a

18+ Lore</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><code>After seeing this, Binary desperately longs to be the victim in that kind of situation. She wants that same aggressive dominance, but against HER.</code></p>
<p>Binary’s undergone a slight personality change from her existence as
an evolved form of her mother, Victoria Black. Back then, she had little
say and was slightly adorable yet destructive. Post separation Binary is
a total asshole , deserving almost constant discipline from her mother.
Victoria Black is a strict , loving mother. She’s disciplined Binary
with belts, punishments and even gentle lightning as a means to catch
her from trying to escape discipline.</p>
