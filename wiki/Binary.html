<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Overview">Overview</span></h2>
<p><b>Binary</b> is the nuclear-powered evolved form and “other half” of <a href="/wiki/Victoria_Black" title="Victoria Black">Victoria Black</a>, created when Victoria pushed beyond her limits with <span class="new" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvVmVnZXRhP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==" title="Vegeta (page does not exist)">Vegeta</span>’s help. Her separation occurred when <span class="new" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvTWVyZ2VkX1phbWFzdT9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=" title="Merged Zamasu (page does not exist)">Merged Zamasu</span> was persuaded to help extract the unstable energy from Victoria Black, resulting in Binary being born as her own being. 
</p><p>Unlike her origin-self, Binary is mean, aggressive, and thrives on destruction. Now that she’s her own entity she really wants to align with evil.  She fears only one thing: <a href="/wiki/Harmony" title="Harmony">Harmony</a> tattling on her to their mother. She is still young minded even though she’s older than Harmony. As such, she is bound by her strict respect for and obedience to her mother. Basically she can’t practice being evil while her family is around. She is far more powerful than Harmony, but envies her emotional bonds. 
</p><p>Binary operates independently and is considered one of the most dangerous entities in the universe. She uses very large all area attacks, able to generate planet-sized nuclear, atomic or Hakai fused blasts. She is easily the family’s goto for desperate times or when all else fails , provided you can convince her. Although as independent, Binary has gained some fighters experience, she is still considered the weakest in the family in that department, much lower than her sister Harmony.
</p><p>Binary as a young woman, realized that she wants to be submissive in the relationship sense, while being very much dominant in the fighting/blasting sense. She will laugh at you as you begin to deteriorate from her blasts, but then suddenly imagine you mounting her helpless body. This in itself is not the most feasible due to the fact that she stands at 5’8 with really big legs and rear and really wide , attention grabbing wings. She assumes she scares off most men. Of course, she would be wrong, but that’s her crazy mind.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Appearance">Appearance</span></h2>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Lore">Lore</span></h2>
<p>On average, when <a href="/wiki/Victoria_Black" title="Victoria Black">Victoria Black</a> undergoes her explosive evolving process, the nuclear energy that becomes <b>Binary</b> is created. Normally, Binary immediately absorbs Victoria’s energy, making her even stronger. This state remains until Binary is “finished” and reverts back into Victoria. 
</p>
<pre>🌌 Binary’s Lore (From Playlist Descriptions)
</pre>
<p>1. Origin
</p><p>“Victoria Black vs Vegeta: The Deal That Created Binary” →
</p><p>Binary was born when Victoria Black struck a deal with Vegeta to break her limits.
</p><p>After Black’s battle with Super Saiyan God Vegeta, her untapped destructive instincts were separated and given form.
</p><p>Binary became the manifestation of Black’s rawest impulses — powerful, reckless, and nuclear.
</p><p>2. Nature &amp; Personality
</p><p>Binary is immensely powerful but unskilled. She lacks battle experience and wastes time on cool one-liners, often leaving herself open.
</p><p>She is destructive, attention-seeking, and emotionally raw — a living extension of the darker side of Victoria Black.
</p><p>Despite her might, she’s easily manipulated or overwhelmed when facing seasoned warriors.
</p><p>3. Early Weakness &amp; Turles Conflict
</p><p>“Turles Steals Binary’s Powers” → Binary is summoned by Black but defeated and drained by Turles.
</p><p>“Victoria’s Jealousy Leads to Disaster” → Chaser’s slip reveals Binary’s weakness (inexperience). Turles plans to exploit it, targeting her specifically.
</p><p>“Weakend Binary is saved from Captain Ginyu” → After losing power to Turles, Binary struggles against Ginyu, nearly falling victim to Body Change, until a warrior named Kenjugi saves her.
</p><p>4. Temporary Defeats
</p><p>“Jerks in the Lobby” → When Black and Harmony are both defeated, Binary is summoned but still fails due to inexperience.
</p><p>Shows that at this point she is more bluster than substance.
</p><p>5. Restoration &amp; Revenge
</p><p>“The Ice Princess Build – Wargirl gets the job done!!” → Wargirl ambushes Turles and reclaims Binary’s stolen power.
</p><p>“Binary Returns to Full Power and Kills OFF Turles!!!” → With her strength restored thanks to Wargirl, Binary personally destroys Turles in revenge.
</p><p>6. Role in Larger Battles
</p><p>In raid scenarios (“Distracting the Raid Boss”), Binary is recognized as one of the raw power characters, used to overwhelm enemies when strategy fails.
</p><p>Her sheer energy output makes her the most “nuclear” fighter among the sisters, even if her skill lags behind.
</p><p>✅ Binary’s Core Themes
</p><p>Origin of Darkness → Born from Black’s ambition and Vegeta’s push.
</p><p>Unstable Power → Strongest in raw might, weakest in discipline.
</p><p>Constant Target → Exploited by Turles, nearly body-swapped by Ginyu.
</p><p>Redemption Arc → After failures, gains revenge on Turles when her power is restored.
</p><p>Symbol of Impulse → She represents what happens when Victoria Black’s recklessness and hunger are unleashed without restraint.
</p><p><br/>
The key problem was that, unlike other fusions such as <span class="new" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvVmVnaXRvP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==" title="Vegito (page does not exist)">Vegito</span>, who know and accept that their existence will eventually end, Binary does not understand this. She does not want to revert. Once she exists, Binary WANTS to exist. She cares very little about missions or goals — her priority is simply continuing her own existence.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="A_Day_of_Normal_Living">A Day of Normal Living</span></h3>
<p>Wanting to show kindness as a mother, Victoria Black once wished to the Dragon to let Binary live one full day as a normal mortal Saiyan. The Dragon granted it, stripping Binary of her immortality, destructive powers, angel wings, and glowing aura. While Binary was free, Victoria remained unconscious, leaving her body guarded by <a href="/wiki/Vanessa" title="Vanessa">Vanessa</a> and <span class="new" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvS2FpP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==" title="Kai (page does not exist)">Kai</span> while <a href="/wiki/Harmony" title="Harmony">Harmony</a> escorted Binary through Conton City.
</p><p>Binary’s mortal day began awkwardly — she explored daily life with curiosity while her protectors watched over her. She quietly remembered things she had never had time to notice: food, music, casual laughter, and even the warm chaos of the Time Patroller marketplace.
</p><p>However, tension rose when she was introduced to <span class="new" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvVHVybGVzP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==" title="Turles (page does not exist)">Turles</span>, who had been tasked by <a href="/wiki/Mira" title="Mira">Mira</a> to protect her during this fragile day. Binary was not afraid of Turles, but deeply unsettled. She remembered how, when she was younger and inexperienced, Turles had stolen her power in a very personal and invasive way while she was unconscious. She also vividly remembered killing him herself with her devastating Core Breaker attack. To see him alive and well was disorienting — and even more so knowing Mira trusted him to protect her now. 
</p><p>Despite her anxiety, Turles kept his word and protected her until he was ultimately defeated. Binary, torn between anger and responsibility, hesitantly restored him — even as flashbacks flooded her mind. Ironically, this may be the seed of her later post-separation infatuation with Turles: he was the only man who had ever been “intimate” with her in any sense, and the contradiction lingered in her heart.
</p><p>Later that day, <span class="new" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvQnJvbHk/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x" title="Broly (page does not exist)">Broly</span> and his team appeared, threatening everything. A fierce team battle erupted. Mortal Binary was vastly outclassed and could not harm Broly, but she used clever distractions to pull him away from her teammate just long enough for that teammate to power up and revive their fallen ally. When Binary’s luck ran out and Broly nearly killed her — which could have meant the end of Victoria Black as well — her teammate struck Broly from behind just in time, stopping the killing blow. They then shouted for Binary to run. Lacking her usual flight abilities, she obeyed and sprinted away to safety as the team finished the fight without her.
</p><p>After Broly’s defeat, Binary shared a warm, uplifting moment with <span class="new" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvR29rdT9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=" title="Goku (page does not exist)">Goku</span> and <span class="new" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvVXViP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==" title="Uub (page does not exist)">Uub</span>, basking in the simple joy of being treated as just another fighter instead of a living weapon. Soon after, her mortal time ended, and she faded back into Victoria Black, carrying with her the bittersweet memory of being truly alive for a day.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Separation">The Separation</span></h3>
<p>The gesture had beautiful intentions but dire consequences. Binary cherished the day deeply, and when she returned, the little memories of her “day out” began flooding Victoria’s mind. Suddenly Victoria could not sleep, focus, or even meditate — Binary’s thoughts were constantly whispering in her head. Harmony, who could communicate with her mother telepathically, sensed how serious the situation was becoming. Binary’s desire for independence, even when sealed back within Victoria, was destabilizing Victoria’s mind. Harmony realized this could not continue — if nothing was done, Binary would eventually consume her mother completely.
</p><p>Harmony proposed that if Binary could be isolated before she absorbed Victoria, both could continue existing — but independently. Victoria, desperate to preserve her own identity and protect her daughter, sought help from <span class="new" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvTWVyZ2VkX1phbWFzdT9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=" title="Merged Zamasu (page does not exist)">Merged Zamasu</span>. By convincing him that “two slaves were better than one,” she persuaded Zamasu to enter the explosion of her evolution and extract Binary’s unstable energy before it overtook her.
</p><p>Zamasu succeeded. At the peak of the explosion, he ripped Binary free before she could fully absorb Victoria. As the dust cleared, Binary remained unconscious but alive, and Victoria was restored. Though the mission was successful, Zamasu reminded Victoria of her debt to him before vanishing. The sisters and allies brought Binary home, shocked to finally see the being that had haunted Victoria’s dreams — now a living person.
</p><p>From that point on, Binary was no longer just an energy form. She was her own being: powerful, destructive, jealous, and deeply hungry to continue existing.
</p><p>== Retaliation and Blood == — The Gas Mask Clan Aftermath
</p><p>In the aftermath of Victoria Chaser’s murder, Binary emerged as the hand of vengeance.
Her aura scorched the planet; her blasts erased even the soil. With Vanessa, she annihilated the Gas Mask Clan’s homeworld, completing the destruction that Victoria Black herself couldn’t commit.
</p><p>It was here Binary first discovered her Destruction Ki, capable of atomizing matter itself —  through rage! 
To her, vengeance felt natural. Her Mother commanded that Binary and Goddess Vanessa destroy everything - and Binary made sure that happened. 
</p><p>💎 4. Harmony’s World — Jealousy and Awakening
</p><p><br/>
When Binary met Harmony for the first time, she saw something she couldn’t process — innocence.
Harmony, Victoria’s second daughter, was born from love and science; Binary, from fury and divine interference.
Binary’s anger toward Harmony had nothing to do with rivalry — it was existential.
Harmony’s laughter reminded her that she was created out of pain, not choice.
</p><p><br/>
🛍️ 5. The Conton City Mall Incident
</p><p><br/>
Binary accompanied Harmony on a day meant for calm. It turned chaotic when Turles appeared.
Harmony, startled by the sight of him, transformed into Super Saiyan 3 — shaking the mall.
while she was transforming, Binary appeared right behind Turles. She had grown an unnatural attraction to him, POSSIBLY as a result of Turless extracting power from her, in a very intimate and personal way, while she was unconscious. Harmony yelled for Binary to get away from him, but Binary didn't care. Turless was totally confused. In front of him was an angry SSJ3 teenager extremely upset at him for no reason, but behind him was a very well developed, barely dressed, gorgeous winged woman, feeling him up as if he needs to do something or she's gonna become indecent. Turless snapped out of it and made some remarks before leaving. Harmony and Gotenks were later struggling against an enemy known as SavageJay. Binary arrived just in time to save the kids. She defeated SavaggeJay with a smaller version of her atomic blast.
</p><p>It was one of the rare scenes where her sarcasm masked pride. For once, she wasn’t angry — she was protective.
</p><p>💋 6. The Turles Connection
</p><p>Turles became Binary’s obsession. His use of her stolen power both disgusted and thrilled her.
She saw in him what she feared within herself — someone who took power without remorse.
Around him, Binary’s anger twisted into curiosity, even attraction. 
</p><p><br/>
🌑 7. The Era of Evil Victoria
</p><p>(Playlist Source: Evil Victoria’s Return, Harmony and Binary Discuss EV’s Motives)
When Evil Victoria surfaced, Binary was the first to question her.
She refused to believe kindness could come from something forged in Zamasu’s shadow.
Binary’s distrust turned to open hostility — she secretly told Vanessa that if Evil Victoria ever endangered VB or Harmony, she would erase her completely, even if it meant erasing part of herself.
</p><p>This period marked Binary’s transition from chaotic destroyer to guardian of her bloodline.
</p><p>🌠 8. The Rivalry Arc — Binary vs Harmony
</p><p>(Playlist Source: Sisters of Destruction Training Arc, Harmony Awakens SSJ3 in Binary’s Presence)
When Harmony’s SSJ3 power stabilized, Binary challenged her.
Their battle tore open half of Conton’s skyline. Binary reached her Full Power Fluorescent Form, emitting light so intense that the air shimmered like plasma.
But in the middle of the fight, she stopped — realizing she would kill her sister if she continued.
That was Binary’s first act of mercy. The first sign that she was more than anger incarnate.
</p><p>🕊️ 9. Current Era — The Angel of Ruin
</p><p>Now, Binary stands as both warning and weapon.
Her relationship with Victoria Black has matured into mutual understanding: mother and creation, mirror and shadow.
Though she pretends to disdain family bonds, she quietly protects Harmony and Wargirl from afar, and keeps watch for Turles’s return.
</p><p>Her silver wings are said to dim when she’s lonely, and glow blindingly when she feels pride — proof that emotion, even in gods, is the truest source of power.
</p>
<pre> 10 . Binary and Harmony recently interrupted Evil Victoria, as they assumed she was doing something evil and Harmony wanted to test her device meant to trap the evil villainess.  Unfortunately for them, Evil Victoria was actually sexually pleasing her "girlfriend", Shy Kefla. When they interrupted the intimate couple , Shy Kefla burst into a rage and attacked Binary, separating them from EVil Victoria and Harmony. Evil Victoria was dealing with SSJ3 Harmony, but Goddess Vanessa joined the fight. Meanwhile Binary powered up to match the energy Kefla was at. Some time during the fight, Shy Kefla got distracted as Harmony used Goddess Vanessa's distracting Evil Victoria as a chance to ignite her Prysm trap. The unexpected Evil Victoria was partially trapped, but Shy Kefla shot a blast at the device, freeing her. Binary took advantage of the distraction to land a devastating blow , sending Kefla flying far away. Binary caught up to her , smashing Kefla to the ground. While Kefla lay knocked out briefly, Binary floated above her, cockily preparing to ignite herself into an atomic style bomb. As she ignited, Kefla started to wake up, but it was already too late. Binary ignited a massive bomb blast that extended far out. Evil Victoria sensed something was wrong as she was busy fighting Harmony and Goddess Vanessa. She felt the heat and demanded to know what was going on. Goddess Vanesssa confirmed Binary's intent to destroy Shy Kefla was starting. Evil Victoria broke free from the two women and blasted towards Shy Kefla, who was taking serious damage inside Binary's explosion. EVil Victoria made it to Kefla and put up a barrier around the two of them. Evil Victoria was recovering in the shield but Shy Kefla was running out of Fusion time. Evil Victoria kissed Shy Kefla, resetting her fusion for a while. The kiss drained alot of Evil Victorias powers though, and her barrier started to give. As the barrier began to crack, Evil Victoria yelled for Fused Zamasu's assistance. He fired a connection beam straight to Evil Victoria who was inside the blast. This recharged her and brought her power back to full. She then reinforced her barrier and took Shy Kelfa out of the blast and away . With the threat gone, Binary's ever expanding bomb was the new concern. Harmony communicated with Victoria Black, who, in turn, commanded Binary to stop. Binary shut down the blast...

<pre>After seeing this, Binary desperately longs to be the victim in that kind of situation. She wants that same aggressive dominance, but against HER.
</pre>
<p>Binary’s undergone a slight personality change from her existence as an evolved form of her mother, Victoria Black. Back then, she had little say and was slightly adorable yet destructive. Post separation Binary is a total asshole , deserving almost constant discipline from her mother. Victoria Black is a strict , loving mother. She’s disciplined Binary with belts, punishments and even gentle lightning as a means to catch her from trying to escape discipline.
