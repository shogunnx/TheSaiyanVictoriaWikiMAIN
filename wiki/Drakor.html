<p>Drakor: The Honorable Rival Drakor embodies the classic rival
archetype, yet his evolution transforms him into something far more
significant. Introduced as the formidable leader of the "Night
Shifters," an elite team of fighters, he first appears as a persistent
challenger to Victoria Black and her sisters in Conton City's fighting
circuit. He is a tenacious and tactical warrior, possessing strength on
par with top Saiyan fighters, but his true importance lies in his
character arc. Initially a straightforward antagonist, Drakor's
relationship with the heroes gradually shifts from pure rivalry to
begrudging respect, and eventually to that of an anti-heroic ally. His
battles with Victoria, Wargirl, and Binary are tests of skill that end
not in annihilation, but in earned respect. Over time, this dynamic
evolves to the point where Drakor actively intervenes to "defend
Victoria and her family from dishonor and corruption in Conton City".
This is a critical transition; he moves from challenging their power to
upholding their values. He operates under his own code of honor, often
handling lesser threats by claiming he will be the one to defeat the
Saiyan sisters one day, and thus will not allow anyone else to weaken
them or cheat them of an honorable fight. In this capacity, Drakor's
existence serves as an external moral compass for the heroes. As he
transforms from enemy to a protector of their "honor," he implicitly
holds them to a standard of conduct. His presence poses a constant,
unspoken question: are the heroes living up to the principles that even
their staunchest rival has come to respect and defend? He becomes a
mirror reflecting their own code, a thematic counterweight to the
universe's more chaotic and dishonorable villains. His fate is not to be
defeated, but to endure as a recurring "friendly rival," a permanent
fixture who ensures the integrity of the fight itself is maintained.</p>

<p><a href="The_Past_Warrior.html">The Past Warrior</a> is an alternate
version of Drakor, originating from the distant past. He is a powerful
ancient Saiyan who has mastered the Super Saiyan 3 form to the point of
permanence. Unlike modern Saiyans, The Past Warrior maintains his SSJ3
without the severe stamina drain, wielding his heavy sword and clad in
dark warrior armor with a tan scarf and leather gloves. His stoic nature
and unyielding presence mark him as a symbol of the lost age of Saiyan
honor.</p>
