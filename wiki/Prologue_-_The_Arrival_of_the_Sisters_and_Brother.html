<h1>Prologue - The Arrival of the Sisters and Brother</h1>
<p><em>Canon status: Prime Canon</em></p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Victoria Universe begins in a doomed future ruled by
<a href="Black_Frieza_-Future.html">Black Frieza</a>. Facing enslavement
and annihilation, the siblings—<a href="Victoria_Chaser.html">Victoria
Chaser</a>, <a href="Victoria_Black.html">Victoria Black</a>,
<a href="Wargirl.html">Wargirl</a>, and their brother
<a href="Kai.html">Kai</a> (a dojo master)—escape into the past. Their
goal is simple and impossible: grow strong before Black Frieza’s rise
and change history.</p>
<h2 id="section_1_escape_from_black_friezas_future">Section 1 — Escape
From Black Frieza’s Future</h2>
<p>In the original future timeline, Black Frieza’s dominion leaves
Saiyans broken, enslaved, or dead. The siblings realize resistance is
futile in that era and choose timeflight to the past. In the past, they
commit to training, forging alliances, and outgrowing fate before Black
Frieza can ascend. Unknowns to fill: time travel method [TBD]; arrival
year/location [TBD].</p>
<h2 id="section_2_saiyan_girl_victoria_chaser_original_lead">Section 2 —
Saiyan Girl Victoria Chaser (Original Lead)</h2>
<p>Eldest twin and original lead. Honorable, disciplined, determined to
“do it the hard way.” Clashes with
<a href="Victoria_Black.html">Victoria Black</a> over
<a href="Harmony.html">Harmony</a>’s upbringing (Harmony Blaster):
Chaser demands earned strength; Black tries to shield her. In battle,
Chaser is decisive; when Black falters against
<a href="Gogeta.html">Gogeta</a>, Chaser avenges her. Flaws: jealousy
and rashness that later prime her for a risky deal with
<a href="Turles.html">Turles</a>, leading to Victoria Blue.</p>
<h2 id="section_3_victoria_black_seduction_and_recklessness">Section 3 —
Victoria Black: Seduction and Recklessness</h2>
<p>Black wields allure, strategy, and distance control. She prefers
flowers to gore but is drawn to temptation. Positions herself as
Harmony’s “mother,” hurling herself into danger to protect her—often
needing Chaser to pull her out. <strong>Jerks in the Lobby
(Incident):</strong> harassment and defeats spiral until Chaser rescues
the team; this pushes Chaser toward seeking more power. <strong>Duel
with <a href="Vegeta.html">Vegeta</a>:</strong> after goading him into a
deal, Black witnesses his Final Explosion. She later replicates
it—birthing <a href="Binary.html">Binary</a>. Binary immediately tests
herself and defeats Vegeta. Later, <a href="Towa.html">Towa</a>
possesses Black; <a href="Gogeta.html">Gogeta</a> restrains her without
killing. Black admits she enjoyed the evil, hinting at darker
temptations.</p>
<h2 id="section_4_binary_the_extreme_of_black">Section 4 — Binary: The
Extreme of Black</h2>
<p>Binary is Black’s extremes given form: overwhelming strength, beauty,
and appetite for dominance. Inexperience shows; she wastes openings with
grandstanding, making her a target for schemers.
<a href="Turles.html">Turles</a> drains her power;
<a href="Captain_Ginyu.html">Captain Ginyu</a> nearly steals her body.
<strong>Restoration:</strong> <a href="Wargirl.html">Wargirl</a>,
<a href="Harmony.html">Harmony</a>, and a male Saiyan ally ambush Turles
and reclaim Binary’s energy. When Turles storms their home demanding the
energy back, Black transforms into Binary and destroys Turles
permanently.</p>
<h2 id="section_5_wargirl_the_youngest_fighter">Section 5 — Wargirl: The
Youngest Fighter</h2>
<p>5'7", 150 lbs. Scrappy PvP spirit. Begins as the team’s PQ farmer,
accelerating allies’ growth. Harmony’s main training partner; contrasts
with Chaser’s strictness and Black’s recklessness. Orchestrates the
Turles ambush that restores Binary’s power, enabling Turles’ end.</p>
<h2 id="section_6_themes_of_the_prologue">Section 6 — Themes of the
Prologue</h2>
<p><strong>Chaser:</strong> honor and burden vs jealousy and risk.
<strong>Black:</strong> seduction, manipulation, and reckless protection
birthing Binary. <strong>Binary:</strong> a dangerous apex that must
learn control. <strong>Wargirl:</strong> courageous PvP engine and
catalytic teammate. Family as strength and flaw; fugitives from tyranny
trying to rewrite destiny.</p>
<h2 id="continuity">Continuity</h2>
<p>Seeds the Victoria Blue path via <a href="Turles.html">Turles</a>.
Explains the sisters’ training philosophies and intra-family conflict.
Leads into early present-day conflicts and the
<a href="Gas_Mask_Clan_Saga.html">Gas Mask Clan Saga</a>.</p>
