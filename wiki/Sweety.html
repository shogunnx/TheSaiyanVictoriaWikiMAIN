<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Childhood_Accident">Childhood Accident</span></h3>
<p>When She was but only nine years of age, her older brother Gubber was teaching her the signature candy beam on random targets before the one called Veiss and his army conquered the eastern quadrant as well their own world. In a dare to see if she'd actually do it, the dare was to turn their own sun, into a marshmellow. Not one at the time to back down, she boldly turned the rare blue sun known as Bila into that of a everyday marshmellow and furthermore ate it. For what came next was entirely life altering for that suns aptitude and power was both destroying her very being and yet recreating her all at once, through numerous deaths and rebirths that even the smartests of residents on planet Bila had no solution too. Only her mother, had but one solution to save her daughter, and that was to allow sweety to absorb her very being to fortify sweety's. Only Gubber knows the truth of these events and rarely speaks of it without hurting both himself as well sweety who both miss her to this day.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Conton_City_Life">Conton City Life</span></h3>
<p>Sweety is a official nurse at the conton city hospital thanks to the encouragement of toppo. Her days may be long and many show up in drastic injuries or are their because of emotional damage that they lost don't exactly know how to cope with it. Ever on the hunt for the next big fashion trend, she's often seen pressed against the glass of trendy stores across conton city, and... drooling over designer cloths she innocently day dreams of either owning and wearing one day. Her love for Hibachi cuisine is unparalelled and is one she'd fight the most hardened of saiyans to a pulp to have in her tummy for, all stemming from Gubber going to culinary classes to run his dream of owning a restaurant chain across all of conton city, and sweety his biggest influence devoted everything to that dream as a means to redeem himself for darring her all those years ago, yet for sweety, she doesn't remember those events at all.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Relationships">Relationships</span></h3>
<p>Both sweety and gubber were taken in By master Torru as children after news broke out of their homeworld Bila was utterly destroid by Veiss. In his small studio apartment, he taught martial arts to them both. Even as years came and went, they continued under his tutilage on all subjects of chi. Torru also took in new faces for the family to expand with Avianna, the genius. Slush, a shy and quiet frost demon and Ubbra the prankster, whom both sweety and gubber were overjoyed to have. Yet once the family moved to conton city, they had to find careers for themselves outside of fighting to support the aging torru. With gubber it was easy for him, since he knew how to fix and cook, he took a mechanics job as a hoverboard maintenance worker. Yet for sweety it was a much tougher road due to her instability with her powers always causing sudden combustions. It wasn't until a stroll in the city where she met Toppo of the pride troopers that she found for herself a positive function by healing him for the first time after a fight he had with a undisciplined trooper causing a scene. Since then she has made time to visit toppo beforehand as well venture the city of time patrollers.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Meditation_with_Jiren">Meditation with Jiren</span></h3>
<p>It took a solid month of convincing from toppo, Jiren agreed only to train her on the basics. Yet as expect from sweety with her starts sleeping and distractions of cute animals, Toppo bargin in to huge her, the squads themselves handing gift baskets and as one can also imagine, annoying Jiren til he abruptly ends those sessions by walking away to do his own training. Yet upon her first success, he witnessed within sweety a power that forever changed his perspective of sweety as well of what her heart truly is. For he witnessed a innerverse of possibility, hopes and dreams that sweety has only ever shown to those she's ever cared for, even memories with Jiren during each training session, her character fueling Bila's saphire as well empowering her. All he could do was bask under its glow, fully moved by her resolve for a better life. Once he gave her the week off, he Needed to know exactly all things related to sweety, her involvements, her battles prior before training as well her family ties. His Talk with sweety's older brother of the very truth of what happened to her, as well his heavy guilt he did to her that costed the young majins their mother. In secret upon knowing all he knows now, he wanted to hand over her file to victoria black to decide her fate but chose not to. Now among the present day, she unknowingly is in the advanced stages of Jirens mental training, with only himself knowing just how power she can truly be for when the time comes to reveal it all to the very universe itself for when it is in peril.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Powers_and_Abilities">Powers and Abilities</span></h2>
<ul><li><b>Chi of the Blue Sun</b> — This particular blue sun is once known as Bila's saphire. It's very essence alone was once said to be the absolute carnivous in existence. But in irony for being consumed itself by a majin so young, it once completly overwhelmed sweety. Yet now despite being sweety's source of power, it's power stability remain in question as each outburst through sweety's very emotions, being both her greatest strengh as well her very weakness. Despite having Jiren as her mentor and Avianna's tech to keep her as stable to have a functioning life, much remains unanswered on how truly powerful sweety can be should she ever lose herself to its influence entirely...</li>
<li><b>Candy Beam</b> — mostly now used as a party trick to use for celebrations or show wargirl a neat twist to her favorite drinks.</li>
<li><b>Explosive Outbursts</b> — Due to her energy’s instability, Sweety can experience sudden **bodily combustions**, which burn away her clothing or even cause water to instantly vaporize. When calmed, her power remains dormant, but when push and shove from great force, her very arms and legs become engulfed in dense flames, amplifiying her strikes simular to the kaioken.</li>
<li><b>Healing Zone </b> - With Just enough control thanks to Jirens teachings to help control the flux's of the blue sun within her, she can heal allies as well potential rivals without the need for capsule subliments, making her becoming a official nurse for conton city all the more valuble.</li>
<li><b> Final Rampage </b> - Her greatest and most devastating attack that perfectly blends her Burning Chi attacks as well her Striking prowless. Once this attack is applied, sweety enters a state of being Called Overburn... a Vulnerable state that forces sweety's body to melt her body and exudes high intense heats few can withstand.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Weaknesses">Weaknesses</span></h2>
<p>• Cute, Adorable triggers: this happens when she comes across something that she deems Adorable to her eyes and completely losses all her common sense. Often making her Gullable to Dangerous attacks.
</p><p>• Candy: her sweet tooth is in the realm of legends... she lost all control of herself and ate every sweets, cookies, ice cream flavor, pies, Brownies, Brands of chocolates, Caramel. Etc.. This has also Caused her to go into her purification into Kid buu...
</p><p>• Majin Sleep: this has happened for sweety in the records for every three months due to her Majin life cycles, Her longest Hibernation to Date was an entire six months
But thanks to Bila's saphire's effects on sweety... She can Train in her sleep to become moderatly stronger than she was previously by scouter numbers, stacking billions. But this leaves her entirely Vulnerable without no defense. Least she gets sweet dreams🤣
</p><p>•Heartburn: this weakness is fatal to her should she Draw out to much of the blue sun's very power before she is even ready to handle it. Stage one of this is her body melting and losing her figure, struggling to maintain her very being even if she's close to supernova. Stage two is her Body or bits of her body begining to harden and crack, with rays of blue shooting through her.. Its her body finally failing to contain Bila's saphire and this process is beyond painful.
The final stage of heartburn is Death.. full body disintigration at a atomic level. Bila's saphire is released back into space.. She can be ressurected yes, but her personality and loving spirit, they would be gone forever.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Personality">Personality</span></h2>
<p>Sweety is a Free spirited Majin, highly Caring, bit of a accident proned but overall good hearted individual. Despite her everyday challeneges to lead her own life without completely incinerating her attires, She's much like everyone else with her obsessions in fashions, fight finatic wether it be in seatted crowds or participating, and prefers her favorite cuisines in hibachi style foods. Wherever she goes or decides to visit, she makes it her goal in conton city to spread a lil Joy in the city, crack a few Jokes to always lighten the mood, or simply to be a friend for when life happens and changes. Her pilgrimage towards stability may not happen for as long as she's around but is blessed to have a life she can have with her family and friends. And yet...
</p>
<ul><li>Shortest Fuse in Conton* This very title is no understatement, and well given due to ingesting Bila's Saphire. A sun Immensensly powerful within Sweety linked entirely to her emotional spectrum. Should sweety devolve into her anger, fustration, or any of her other volitile feelings, her power Flares, Turning the Majin into a effigy of pure fire or energy, amplifying her already impressive power to a multiplyer based on the moment it happened. What makes this dangerous as well when in this state as well is when she makes numerous hits to her opponent, there own own power decresses more rapidly or destabilizes, meaning no matter what energy one uses, it can be entirely disburst on contact, becoming very vulnerable to her blaze. Hence why Jiren the grey himself is in charge of sweety's mental health.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/Wargirl" title="Wargirl">Wargirl</a></b> — met sweety one to two days in a row on her shifts celebrating her official Nursing status for conton city, serving drinks of the fruity kind, bringing a fire extinguisher everywhere with her whenever she combusts and through small conversations, finds her truly unique for a majin to a point she felt ease with her for the first time in a very long while outside her family. For war girl, it was a night at work she will not be forgetting as she see her go on stage with her family to sing and bring a groove she couldn't help but dance to along with well everyone else. By songs end both wargirl and sweety danced and sang until both in synchronicity both side hipped each other with immense power behind it, it shut down the clubs power, set off car alarms across the parking lot and made wargirl enthralled to how power sweety really is.</li>
<li><b><span class="new" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvSmlyZW4/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x" title="Jiren (page does not exist)">Jiren</span></b> — Probably the last person to ever take on a care for a student in his ways of mental training, his first time meeting her was... disastrous to say the least during a hilarious hoverboard incident ending with a crash to his office. Instantly going for the attack towards sweety with fury. Yet the ones who stood for sweety during this first meet was her older brother Gubber as well Toppo. Each went home with lumps, bruises and black eyes, but admitted it was his fault to begin with for not realizing the start up ignition had a dangerous flaw. His impression of sweety was dour, and yet... for every visit she made to the pride troopers, inviting toppo to family BBQ with Gubber on the grill or cheering for each squad devision before patrol, it reminded him of the lesson of trust that even he must work on. It took a months work of convincing from Toppo to fully evaluate sweety before saying yes to train her. As one could also Imagine during the year it took sweety, it began with a montage of her first few sessions with her falling asleep, to dunking her in swimming pools, and every form of him being embarrased by her whenever a cute animal was around and clobbering her to orbit to meditate on the moon. Yet despite her failings and set backs, did she finally win him over on her first success and revealing to Jiren the most radiant, calming aura. With Bila's saphire revealing itself within being her beating heart, pulsating with a purity he couldn't describe or put on paper. All he could do was bask himself in it as a reward for his patience. Their were times he wanted to hand over sweety's files over to Victoria as administration for what sweety was truly capable of, but deep down she.. made him swear a pinky promise not to until she achieved her own dream of someday becoming the head doctor.</li>
<li><b>Pride Troopers</b> — Though she’s not officially a member, Sweety’s visits and playful nature have earned her respect and camaraderie from the Pride Troopers, especially for her ability to handle difficult patients and situations.</li></ul>
<p>•Toppo - *First of the pride troopers to witness Sweety's contributions first hand and supporter, toppo goes out of his way to see her fulfill her rounds at pride headquaters as a substitue medical officer. The only time the two fought, he was on the defensive against sweety's striking, utterly shocked by the majins natural strength without devolving to her inner sun for power, but control was a fickle topic shortly after as her instability became visually apparant to the point even Jiren had to step in and end the fight himself, knocking her out*

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Trivia">Trivia</span></h2>
<ul><li>Sweety's singing was such a huge hit at the conton city club, Wargirl herself is going leaps and bounds to have her staged as often as she can. Even going as far to visit her family to have bit a small shift just to have her club. Though sweety thinks her voice is annoying, she cannot help but go timid whenever wargirl brags about it, as well the fact that both sweety and wargirl were always in sync on the dancefloor dropping moves together. Sweety still remembers the combined side hips they did to knock out the power.</li>
<li>Sweety’s is a avid animal lover, this usually has her distracted whenever she sees adorable items, accessaries or seeing them across towns as a bystander.</li>
<li>Sweety is bisexual for she has always viewed both men and women attractive. But her experience with her first real relationship has taught her to guard her heart well from those who sought to use her. When she feels ready to be with another, she doesn't want to rush into love, rather to enjoy the Journey for it. And if 18+ or over is to happen... well, she has a twist to the subject she hopes to share it with. [ whip sounds/ but seriously its 18+ or over ]</li>
<li>Despite Sweety being a majin with quirks, accidents, fun side adventures outside the cast and smile's everywhere she goes. She surprises everyone with just how much a human life or close to it she is. Her charm has won people's hearts for just being herself with others, even thoughs who arent as innocent or noble, for even they found themselves admiring this wonderful Majin woman. She eats like a Saiyan, thrives in the majin communities with such praise, has saved already numerous lives already as a nurse that even the supreme Kai of time may reward her achievements in the future.</li>
