<h1>Sweety</h1>
<p><strong>Sweety</strong> is a Majin in the
<a href="TheSaiyanVictoria_Universe.html">Saiyan Victoria Universe</a>.
She is a nurse at the **Conton City Hospital**, where she tends to Time
Patrollers and occasional troublemakers. Her reputation as well use to
heavily revolve around as the shortest fuse of conton city due to her
imstability to control her power and... being caught in her firestorm of
fist, feet and fury. But thanks to toppo as well Jirens efforts, her
outburst of that magnitude have become less often. Now she can be seen
as truly herself and builds towards good relations, but from time to
time finds herself in a hilarious situation.</p>
<h2 id="lore">Lore</h2>
<h3 id="childhood_accident">Childhood Accident</h3>
<p>When She was but only nine years of age, her older brother Gubber was
teaching her the signature candy beam on random targets before the one
called Veiss and his army conquered the eastern quadrant as well their
own world. In a dare to see if she'd actually do it, the dare was to
turn their own sun, into a marshmellow. Not one at the time to back
down, she boldly turned the rare blue sun known as Bila into that of a
everyday marshmellow and furthermore ate it. For what came next was
entirely life altering for that suns aptitude and power was both
destroying her very being and yet recreating her all at once, through
numerous deaths and rebirths that even the smartests of residents on
planet Bila had no solution too. Only her mother, had but one solution
to save her daughter, and that was to allow sweety to absorb her very
being to fortify sweety's. Only Gubber knows the truth of these events
and rarely speaks of it without hurting both himself as well sweety who
both miss her to this day.</p>
<h3 id="conton_city_life">Conton City Life</h3>
<p>Sweety is a official nurse at the conton city hospital thanks to the
encouragement of toppo. Her days may be long and many show up in drastic
injuries or are their because of emotional damage that they lost don't
exactly know how to cope with it. Ever on the hunt for the next big
fashion trend, she's often seen pressed against the glass of trendy
stores across conton city, and... drooling over designer cloths she
innocently day dreams of either owning and wearing one day. Her love for
Hibachi cuisine is unparalelled and is one she'd fight the most hardened
of saiyans to a pulp to have in her tummy for, all stemming from Gubber
going to culinary classes to run his dream of owning a restaurant chain
across all of conton city, and sweety his biggest influence devoted
everything to that dream as a means to redeem himself for darring her
all those years ago, yet for sweety, she doesn't remember those events
at all.</p>
<h3 id="relationships">Relationships</h3>
<p>Both sweety and gubber were taken in By master Torru as children
after news broke out of their homeworld Bila was utterly destroid by
Veiss. In his small studio apartment, he taught martial arts to them
both. Even as years came and went, they continued under his tutilage on
all subjects of chi. Torru also took in new faces for the family to
expand with Avianna, the genius. Slush, a shy and quiet frost demon and
Ubbra the prankster, whom both sweety and gubber were overjoyed to have.
Yet once the family moved to conton city, they had to find careers for
themselves outside of fighting to support the aging torru. With gubber
it was easy for him, since he knew how to fix and cook, he took a
mechanics job as a hoverboard maintenance worker. Yet for sweety it was
a much tougher road due to her instability with her powers always
causing sudden combustions. It wasn't until a stroll in the city where
she met Toppo of the pride troopers that she found for herself a
positive function by healing him for the first time after a fight he had
with a undisciplined trooper causing a scene. Since then she has made
time to visit toppo beforehand as well venture the city of time
patrollers.</p>
<h3 id="meditation_with_jiren">Meditation with Jiren</h3>
<p>It took a solid month of convincing from toppo, Jiren agreed only to
train her on the basics. Yet as expect from sweety with her starts
sleeping and distractions of cute animals, Toppo bargin in to huge her,
the squads themselves handing gift baskets and as one can also imagine,
annoying Jiren til he abruptly ends those sessions by walking away to do
his own training. Yet upon her first success, he witnessed within sweety
a power that forever changed his perspective of sweety as well of what
her heart truly is. For he witnessed a innerverse of possibility, hopes
and dreams that sweety has only ever shown to those she's ever cared
for, even memories with Jiren during each training session, her
character fueling Bila's saphire as well empowering her. All he could do
was bask under its glow, fully moved by her resolve for a better life.
Once he gave her the week off, he Needed to know exactly all things
related to sweety, her involvements, her battles prior before training
as well her family ties. His Talk with sweety's older brother of the
very truth of what happened to her, as well his heavy guilt he did to
her that costed the young majins their mother. In secret upon knowing
all he knows now, he wanted to hand over her file to victoria black to
decide her fate but chose not to. Now among the present day, she
unknowingly is in the advanced stages of Jirens mental training, with
only himself knowing just how power she can truly be for when the time
comes to reveal it all to the very universe itself for when it is in
peril.</p>
<h2 id="powers_and_abilities">Powers and Abilities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chi of the Blue Sun</strong> ‚Äî This particular blue sun is
once known as Bila's saphire. It's very essence alone was once said to
be the absolute carnivous in existence. But in irony for being consumed
itself by a majin so young, it once completly overwhelmed sweety. Yet
now despite being sweety's source of power, it's power stability remain
in question as each outburst through sweety's very emotions, being both
her greatest strengh as well her very weakness. Despite having Jiren as
her mentor and Avianna's tech to keep her as stable to have a
functioning life, much remains unanswered on how truly powerful sweety
can be should she ever lose herself to its influence entirely...</li>
<li><strong>Candy Beam</strong> ‚Äî mostly now used as a party trick to
use for celebrations or show wargirl a neat twist to her favorite
drinks.</li>
<li><strong>Explosive Outbursts</strong> ‚Äî Due to her energy‚Äôs
instability, Sweety can experience sudden **bodily combustions**, which
burn away her clothing or even cause water to instantly vaporize. When
calmed, her power remains dormant, but when push and shove from great
force, her very arms and legs become engulfed in dense flames,
amplifiying her strikes simular to the kaioken.</li>
<li><strong>Healing Zone</strong> - With Just enough control thanks to
Jirens teachings to help control the flux's of the blue sun within her,
she can heal allies as well potential rivals without the need for
capsule subliments, making her becoming a official nurse for conton city
all the more valuble.</li>
<li><strong>Final Rampage</strong> - Her greatest and most devastating
attack that perfectly blends her Burning Chi attacks as well her
Striking prowless. Once this attack is applied, sweety enters a state of
being Called Overburn... a Vulnerable state that forces sweety's body to
melt her body and exudes high intense heats few can withstand.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h2>
<p>‚Ä¢ Cute, Adorable triggers: this happens when she comes across
something that she deems Adorable to her eyes and completely losses all
her common sense. Often making her Gullable to Dangerous attacks.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Candy: her sweet tooth is in the realm of legends... she lost all
control of herself and ate every sweets, cookies, ice cream flavor,
pies, Brownies, Brands of chocolates, Caramel. Etc.. This has also
Caused her to go into her purification into Kid buu...</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Majin Sleep: this has happened for sweety in the records for every
three months due to her Majin life cycles, Her longest Hibernation to
Date was an entire six months But thanks to Bila's saphire's effects on
sweety... She can Train in her sleep to become moderatly stronger than
she was previously by scouter numbers, stacking billions. But this
leaves her entirely Vulnerable without no defense. Least she gets sweet
dreamsü§£</p>
<p>‚Ä¢Heartburn: this weakness is fatal to her should she Draw out to much
of the blue sun's very power before she is even ready to handle it.
Stage one of this is her body melting and losing her figure, struggling
to maintain her very being even if she's close to supernova. Stage two
is her Body or bits of her body begining to harden and crack, with rays
of blue shooting through her.. Its her body finally failing to contain
Bila's saphire and this process is beyond painful. The final stage of
heartburn is Death.. full body disintigration at a atomic level. Bila's
saphire is released back into space.. She can be ressurected yes, but
her personality and loving spirit, they would be gone forever.</p>
<h2 id="personality">Personality</h2>
<p>Sweety is a Free spirited Majin, highly Caring, bit of a accident
proned but overall good hearted individual. Despite her everyday
challeneges to lead her own life without completely incinerating her
attires, She's much like everyone else with her obsessions in fashions,
fight finatic wether it be in seatted crowds or participating, and
prefers her favorite cuisines in hibachi style foods. Wherever she goes
or decides to visit, she makes it her goal in conton city to spread a
lil Joy in the city, crack a few Jokes to always lighten the mood, or
simply to be a friend for when life happens and changes. Her pilgrimage
towards stability may not happen for as long as she's around but is
blessed to have a life she can have with her family and friends. And
yet...</p>
<ul>
<li>Shortest Fuse in Conton* This very title is no understatement, and
well given due to ingesting Bila's Saphire. A sun Immensensly powerful
within Sweety linked entirely to her emotional spectrum. Should sweety
devolve into her anger, fustration, or any of her other volitile
feelings, her power Flares, Turning the Majin into a effigy of pure fire
or energy, amplifying her already impressive power to a multiplyer based
on the moment it happened. What makes this dangerous as well when in
this state as well is when she makes numerous hits to her opponent,
there own own power decresses more rapidly or destabilizes, meaning no
matter what energy one uses, it can be entirely disburst on contact,
becoming very vulnerable to her blaze. Hence why Jiren the grey himself
is in charge of sweety's mental health.</li>
</ul>
<p>afterward.</p>
<h2 id="key_relationships">Key Relationships</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="Wargirl.html">Wargirl</a></strong> ‚Äî met sweety one
to two days in a row on her shifts celebrating her official Nursing
status for conton city, serving drinks of the fruity kind, bringing a
fire extinguisher everywhere with her whenever she combusts and through
small conversations, finds her truly unique for a majin to a point she
felt ease with her for the first time in a very long while outside her
family. For war girl, it was a night at work she will not be forgetting
as she see her go on stage with her family to sing and bring a groove
she couldn't help but dance to along with well everyone else. By songs
end both wargirl and sweety danced and sang until both in synchronicity
both side hipped each other with immense power behind it, it shut down
the clubs power, set off car alarms across the parking lot and made
wargirl enthralled to how power sweety really is.</li>
<li><strong><a href="Jiren.html">Jiren</a></strong> ‚Äî Probably the last
person to ever take on a care for a student in his ways of mental
training, his first time meeting her was... disastrous to say the least
during a hilarious hoverboard incident ending with a crash to his
office. Instantly going for the attack towards sweety with fury. Yet the
ones who stood for sweety during this first meet was her older brother
Gubber as well Toppo. Each went home with lumps, bruises and black eyes,
but admitted it was his fault to begin with for not realizing the start
up ignition had a dangerous flaw. His impression of sweety was dour, and
yet... for every visit she made to the pride troopers, inviting toppo to
family BBQ with Gubber on the grill or cheering for each squad devision
before patrol, it reminded him of the lesson of trust that even he must
work on. It took a months work of convincing from Toppo to fully
evaluate sweety before saying yes to train her. As one could also
Imagine during the year it took sweety, it began with a montage of her
first few sessions with her falling asleep, to dunking her in swimming
pools, and every form of him being embarrased by her whenever a cute
animal was around and clobbering her to orbit to meditate on the moon.
Yet despite her failings and set backs, did she finally win him over on
her first success and revealing to Jiren the most radiant, calming aura.
With Bila's saphire revealing itself within being her beating heart,
pulsating with a purity he couldn't describe or put on paper. All he
could do was bask himself in it as a reward for his patience. Their were
times he wanted to hand over sweety's files over to Victoria as
administration for what sweety was truly capable of, but deep down she..
made him swear a pinky promise not to until she achieved her own dream
of someday becoming the head doctor.</li>
<li><strong>Pride Troopers</strong> ‚Äî Though she‚Äôs not officially a
member, Sweety‚Äôs visits and playful nature have earned her respect and
camaraderie from the Pride Troopers, especially for her ability to
handle difficult patients and situations.</li>
</ul>
<p>‚Ä¢Toppo - *First of the pride troopers to witness Sweety's
contributions first hand and supporter, toppo goes out of his way to see
her fulfill her rounds at pride headquaters as a substitue medical
officer. The only time the two fought, he was on the defensive against
sweety's striking, utterly shocked by the majins natural strength
without devolving to her inner sun for power, but control was a fickle
topic shortly after as her instability became visually apparant to the
point even Jiren had to step in and end the fight himself, knocking her
out*</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="Victoria_Black.html">Victoria Black</a></strong> ‚Äî
on two seperate times, they somewhat know one another, the first being
to take a picture of a happy toppo hugging sweety in her yoga outfit and
hilariously squeaking. ( Probably still on her phone to this day. ) and
another time while on call to a fight in the city, tending to victoria
blacks minor injuries, though they both wanted to have conversation,
victorias exhaustion bested her this day, but in sweety's generousity,
she handed victoria a rob so the residents don't see more than they
deserve, before departing to the next battleground to heal others til
cloakout.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notable_moments">Notable Moments</h2>
<ul>
<li>surviving the energy of the rare blue sun in childhood, she's
naturally a grand curiousity of how her bursts even work. Yet more
Importantly is the question of how she survived it entirely.</li>
<li>since becoming a nurse, Regularly tending to the Time Patrollers and
troublemakers at Conton City Hospital. She rarely gets time off from her
long shifts, yet as she ventures across conton city, she founded time
for herself to visit several places before work.</li>
<li>Working alongside the Pride Troopers and meditating with Jiren to
maintain balance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Though not officially a pride trooper to say, she was given just
enough access to cheer the squads on before daily deployment, have her
usual talks with toppo, til squeezed by his infamous hugs.</p>
<h2 id="trivia">Trivia</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sweety's singing was such a huge hit at the conton city club,
Wargirl herself is going leaps and bounds to have her staged as often as
she can. Even going as far to visit her family to have bit a small shift
just to have her club. Though sweety thinks her voice is annoying, she
cannot help but go timid whenever wargirl brags about it, as well the
fact that both sweety and wargirl were always in sync on the dancefloor
dropping moves together. Sweety still remembers the combined side hips
they did to knock out the power.</li>
<li>Sweety‚Äôs is a avid animal lover, this usually has her distracted
whenever she sees adorable items, accessaries or seeing them across
towns as a bystander.</li>
<li>Sweety is bisexual for she has always viewed both men and women
attractive. But her experience with her first real relationship has
taught her to guard her heart well from those who sought to use her.
When she feels ready to be with another, she doesn't want to rush into
love, rather to enjoy the Journey for it. And if 18+ or over is to
happen... well, she has a twist to the subject she hopes to share it
with. [ whip sounds/ but seriously its 18+ or over ]</li>
<li>Despite Sweety being a majin with quirks, accidents, fun side
adventures outside the cast and smile's everywhere she goes. She
surprises everyone with just how much a human life or close to it she
is. Her charm has won people's hearts for just being herself with
others, even thoughs who arent as innocent or noble, for even they found
themselves admiring this wonderful Majin woman. She eats like a Saiyan,
thrives in the majin communities with such praise, has saved already
numerous lives already as a nurse that even the supreme Kai of time may
reward her achievements in the future.</li>
<li>She is very acrobatic, flexible and surprisingly well fit. Despite
being more a food lover than fighter, she made herself a promise that if
she is to fight, she would want a fair fight like she once had with
pumpikon back when she had a rival to face. Winning or losing matters
not to sweety so long as she can keep herself under control before she
goes nova.</li>
