<strong>Veronica</strong> is a rare human ally in the
<a href="TheSaiyanVictoria_Universe.html">Saiyan Victoria universe</a>.
She plays a pivotal role during the <a href="Broly.html">Broly</a> raid
by finding and reviving <a href="Wargirl.html">Wargirl</a> after a
devastating blow. Unlike the Saiyan sisters, Veronica relies on a
scientifically engineered suit and electric gauntlets, allowing her to
stand alongside super-powered fighters through ingenuity and
courage.</p>
<h2 id="lore">Lore</h2>
<h3 id="the_broly_battle">The Broly Battle</h3>
<p>During the raid against Broly, <a href="Wargirl.html">Wargirl</a> is
blasted across the battlefield and left gravely injured. Veronica
discovers her, revives her, and reassures her despite the danger. When
Wargirl doubts how a human could fight Broly, Veronica reveals a
science-powered combat suit— fueled by Dragon Ball energy—and gauntlets
that generate massive purple electricity. She enters the fight and, with
other raiders, helps drive Broly away.</p>
<h3 id="romantic_undertone">Romantic Undertone</h3>
<p>Though Wargirl thanks her, she slips away before realizing Veronica’s
feelings. Veronica becomes smitten from the moment of rescue and spends
weeks daydreaming about Wargirl, building the resolve to find her
again.</p>
<h3 id="the_search">The Search</h3>
<p>Determined, Veronica begins tracking Wargirl across Conton City. Her
search leads her to <strong>Kai</strong>, who points her toward
Wargirl’s workplace at the <strong>Conton City Resort</strong>. By the
time she arrives, Wargirl has already left to avenge
<a href="Victoria_Black.html">Victoria Black</a> and is later kidnapped
by the Black Knight. Despite the chaos of god-tier conflicts, Veronica
continues her human, tireless search.

<h3 id="reunion_at_the_club">Reunion at the Club</h3>
<p>Veronica eventually tracks Wargirl to the <strong>Conton City
Club</strong>, where Wargirl works after her rescue. Nervous but
determined, Veronica steps through the entrance—setting up their
long-awaited reunion. <em>To be continued.</em></p>
