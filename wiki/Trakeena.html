<h1>Trakeena</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Trakeena</strong> is a rising antagonist in the
<em>TheSaiyanVictoria Universe</em>. A powerful Majin empress, she
cloaks her ambitions behind a façade of regal composure. Her true goal
is to capture <a href="Veronica.html">Veronica</a>, seeking to extract
and harness the source of Veronica’s unique scientific powers for her
own empire.</p>
<h2 id="appearance">Appearance</h2>
<p>Trakeena embodies the classic Majin form, with smooth pink skin,
sharp feminine curves, and elegant attire that fuses royal empress garb
with the elastic adaptability of her Majin body. Her crown-like
headpiece and flowing robes mark her status, while her aura radiates
both majesty and menace.</p>
<h2 id="personality">Personality</h2>
<p>Coldly ambitious and calculating, Trakeena is as much a strategist as
she is a warrior. She does not waste energy in needless displays of
strength; instead, she prefers to manipulate and scheme, letting others
fall into her traps. Beneath her elegance lies a ruthless hunger for
control over knowledge and power.</p>
<h2 id="powers_and_abilities">Powers and Abilities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Majin Physiology</strong> – Elastic, regenerative body with
high resistance to physical damage.</li>
<li><strong>Absorption Arts</strong> – Ability to absorb knowledge or
energy by engulfing a target, leaving them drained.</li>
<li><strong>Psionic Command</strong> – Projects her will into
subordinates, binding weaker minds to her orders.</li>
<li><strong>Science Seeker</strong> – Unique obsession with harnessing
<a href="Veronica.html">Veronica</a>’s engineering genius; rumored to be
developing Majin–machine hybrids.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>Trakeena’s central objective is the capture of
<a href="Veronica.html">Veronica</a>, believing the scientist’s
inventions and hidden energy source will ensure the eternal reign of the
Majin Dominion.</p>
<h2 id="role_in_the_story">Role in the Story</h2>
<p>As an upcoming villainess, Trakeena will emerge as a direct foil to
Veronica — not seeking to destroy her, but to exploit her mind and
essence. This makes her an unusually cerebral Majin antagonist, more
dangerous for her cunning than for sheer strength.</p>
