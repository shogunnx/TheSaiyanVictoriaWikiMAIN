<strong>Evil Victoria</strong>, is the primary antagonist of the
<em>Divinity's Puppet</em> story arc. A malevolent and twisted version
of the mother of <strong>Harmony</strong> and <strong>Binary</strong>,
Evil Victoria acts as a direct physical vessel for the divine power of
her master, <strong>Fused Zamasu</strong>. Victoria Black made a pact
long ago, that in exchange for granting her immortality, she would give
servitude to Zamasu. The pact later increased when Victoria Black went
to Fused Zamasu to get help extracting Binary from within her. As a way
to be sure Victoria Black would be available, Zamasu created an evil
version of her. This version of Victoria has no job, no children, and no
other obligation so she is 100% available whenever Zamasu should need
Victoria. Evil Victoria is a spoiled, bratty villainess who takes what
she wants and escapes from fights she cannot win. She thrives on your
hatered for her because that makes it more satisfying when she forces
you to submit to her. While possessing immense energy, Evil Victoria's
core motivation stems from a deluded, unrequited obsession to court
Fused Zamasu and prove herself worthy of being his consort.</p>
<p>==Appearance==</p>
<p>Evil Victoria is a tall, confident woman who bears a striking
resemblance to Victoria Black, the mother of Harmony and Binary. She has
pristine silver hair styled in a large, elegant bun and glowing,
piercing silver eyes that betray her immense power. She wears a
form-fitting, long-sleeved black and red bodysuit with red thigh straps
and black strappy high heels.</p>
<h2 id="personality">Personality</h2>
<p><code>On the surface, Evil Victoria projects an aura of supreme arrogance and untouchable confidence. She views her opponents, even powerful fighters like </code><strong><code>Beast Gohan</code></strong><code>, as "insects" and "tiresome interruptions" who are beneath her notice. This arrogance, however, is a facade covering deep-seated insecurities.</code></p>
<p>Evil Victoria is not a true warrior and lacks refined martial arts
skill. This leads to a profound fear of being challenged in a direct,
fair fight. When confronted by a skilled opponent who cannot be easily
overwhelmed, her confident demeanor shatters, and she is prone to
childish "temper tantrums," complaining and showing insubordination
towards her master. Her entire being is driven by a tragic and obsessive
desire for the approval and affection of Fused Zamasu. She interprets
his manipulation and avoidance as a temporary delay before he accepts
her as his partner. This delusion is the source of both her power and
her ultimate weakness, as she is willing to endure anything to prove her
worth to a master who is incapable of seeing her as anything more than a
useful tool.</p>
<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p><code>Evil Victoria usually only appears in the classroom where Victoria Black teaches. She only appears after hours. She usually wins her battles thru manipulation, deceit and her own dark powers. She is very physically attracted to herself, and often spends her time admiring herself, mainly her legs, and her pedicure. She has a fetish for heels and wears the strappy black heels to encourage that fetish when not in use by her master. Her first public appearance on Earth was overseeing a bank heist with her underlings. She wanted some of the money from the heist. Her arrival caught the attention of Harmony and Binary, who were shocked by her resemblance to their mother. After a brief confrontation, Evil Victoria's connection to a divine power became clear.</code></p>
<p>Her plans were later interrupted by the arrival of Beast Gohan.
Terrified of facing a skilled martial artist, Evil Victoria nearly
abandoned the fight until Fused Zamasu reassured her, promising to
continuously supply her with his divine energy. Fueled by this power,
she was able to withstand Beast Gohan's most powerful attacks,
regenerating almost immediately from all damage and ultimately achieving
her goal. In the aftermath, she was seen calmly counting her spoils,
completely dismissive of the epic battle that had just occurred.</p>
<p><strong>Divine Energy Conduit:</strong> Victoria's primary and most
powerful ability. She serves as a direct channel for Fused Zamasu's
immense divine ki, allowing her to wield god-level power without having
earned it herself.</p>
<p><strong>Regeneration/Immortality:</strong> So long as her connection
to Zamasu is maintained, she can instantly regenerate from any and all
damage, making her effectively immortal in battle.</p>
<p><strong>Energy Blasts:</strong> She can project powerful blasts of
divine energy. She also borrows the Lightning of Absolution- Purple
Lightning.</p>
<p><strong>Flight:</strong> The ability to fly using ki.</p>
<p><strong>Fused Zamasu:</strong> Victoria is obsessively devoted to her
"master." She wishes to court him and become his partner,
misinterpreting his manipulation as a test of her loyalty. Zamasu, in
turn, sees her as a convenient puppet, exploiting her feelings to ensure
her obedience.</p>
<p><strong>Harmony &amp; Binary:</strong> She views her "daughters" with
condescension, seeing them as failures and obstacles to her grand plans
with Zamasu.</p>
<p><strong>Gohan:</strong> Victoria holds a special hatred for Gohan, as
he represents everything she is not: a true warrior with earned power
and refined skill. His presence shatters her confidence and forces her
to rely completely on Zamasu's intervention.</p>
<p>(To Harmony) <em>"Well, well, well. Shouldn't you be in bed,
Harmony?"</em></p>
<p><em>"Oh darling, I am her. Just far less forgiving."</em></p>
<p>(From her Instagram post) <em>"Is this truly the best this world has
to offer? Pathetic."</em></p>
<p>Her theme music is a "creepy and unhealthy" version of Victoria
Black's theme song, "Let's Do it! - Minako Yoshida", symbolizing her
corrupted nature.</p>
<p>She is totally spoiled and in love with herself. She is an avid
collector of fashionable heels and is usually too busy glossing over
herself to regard others.</p>
<p>She posts alot on Instagram.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="powers_abilities">Powers &amp; Abilities</h2>
<h3 id="independent_powers">Independent Powers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immortality:</strong> Like Victoria Black, Evil Victoria’s
body is naturally immortal. She cannot be killed by conventional means,
and her body restores itself even after catastrophic damage.</li>
<li><strong>Saiyan Bloodline Power:</strong> Retains the combat
instincts, strength, and limitless growth potential of her Saiyan
lineage.</li>
<li><strong>Divine Ki Core:</strong> Infused with Zamasu’s energy from

body does not tire in battle. She can sustain combat indefinitely
without energy loss.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="borrowed_powers_via_merged_zamasu">Borrowed Powers (via Merged
Zamasu)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Divine Link:</strong> Evil Victoria has a direct, active
line with Merged Zamasu. She can channel his godly ki at will.</li>
<li><strong>Dual Regeneration:</strong> Her body restores itself
naturally, but when she takes massive damage, Zamasu himself reinforces
and repairs her instantly, ensuring no downtime.</li>
<li><strong>Borrowed Energy Attacks:</strong> Can “borrow” raw divine
power from Zamasu to generate attacks far beyond her normal limits.
Notably, she once unleashed a <strong>planet-sized purple blast</strong>
that nearly killed Beast Gohan.</li>
<li><strong>Battlefield Insurance:</strong> She refused to fight Gohan
until Zamasu promised she would not be defeated, showing her reliance on
the divine tether in high-stakes fights.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="powers_and_abilities">Powers and Abilities</h2>
<h3 id="immortality">Immortality</h3>
<p>Evil Victoria retains full <strong>immortality</strong>, the same as
Victoria Black, allowing her to survive injuries that would kill any
mortal.</p>
<h3 id="homing_dark_blasts">Homing Dark Blasts</h3>
<p>Her signature combat relies on <strong>dark, homing energy
blasts</strong> that relentlessly pursue her opponents until
contact.</p>
<h3 id="dark_ki_chains">Dark Ki Chains</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Purple chains of condensed Ki that
latch onto enemies.</li>
<li><strong>Effects</strong>: Used to bind or restrain faster opponents.
Can also pull them into range.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced State</strong>: When combined with her
<em>Horizontal Lightning of Absolution</em>, the chains channel violent
energy currents that electrocute her targets.</li>
<li><strong>Notable Use</strong>: Successfully captured
<a href="Goddess_of_Destruction_Vanessa.html">Goddess of Destruction
Vanessa</a> despite her speed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="horizontal_lightning_of_absolution">Horizontal Lightning of
Absolution</h3>
<p>A destructive current of purple electricity sent through her
<strong>Dark Ki Chains</strong>, magnifying damage and overwhelming foes
once they are bound.</p>
<h3 id="shadow_barrier">Shadow Barrier</h3>
<p>Evil Victoria can generate a <strong>purple Ki barrier</strong>. It
is slightly weaker than those of Victoria Black or Goddess Vanessa, but
it can absorb massive attacks temporarily. She can also heal herself
while inside the barrier.</p>
<h3 id="fusion_reset_kiss">Fusion Reset Kiss</h3>
<p>By kissing <strong>Shy Kefla</strong>, Evil Victoria can</p>
<h3 id="strategic_danger">Strategic Danger</h3>
<ul>
<li>Evil Victoria represents a <strong>dual threat</strong>:
<ul>
<li>As a fighter, she is immortal, manipulative, and dangerously calm
under pressure.</li>
<li>As a conduit, she is backed by Merged Zamasu’s endless divine power,
making her a living proxy weapon for his godhood.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This layered system means she cannot be permanently destroyed and
can escalate into devastating levels of power whenever Zamasu wills
it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Divine Dependence:</strong> While powerful on her own, her
most devastating abilities rely on her connection to Merged Zamasu.
Severing or disrupting this link could greatly reduce her effectiveness
in battle.</li>
<li><strong>Emotional Manipulation Vulnerability:</strong> Her greatest
weapon is her gentle, manipulative persona. However, once opponents
recognize her tactics, her subtle control over allies and enemies
becomes less effective.</li>
<li><strong>Reluctance Without Assurance:</strong> Evil Victoria
sometimes refuses to engage unless Zamasu guarantees her victory. This
hesitation can delay her responses in urgent combat situations.</li>
<li><strong>Proxy Limitation:</strong> Because she serves as Zamasu’s
conduit, her actions can sometimes be influenced or interrupted by his
will, limiting her independence in critical moments.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Rarely fights with full aggression, which can be exploited in direct
combat.</li>
<li>Her desire for genuine intimacy (especially with
<a href="Kefla.html">Kefla</a>) can cloud her judgment and weaken her
resolve.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>Evil Victoria’s primary mission is to weaken or eliminate the
powerful fusions that could threaten her master. By creating hesitation,
trust, and misplaced loyalty, she ensures that the warriors capable of
forming fusions are left divided or compromised. This goal appears to be
succeeding: with **two major fusions already out of the way, and both
<a href="Goku.html">Goku</a> and <a href="Vegeta.html">Vegeta</a>
occupied between their roles in creating both
<a href="Gogeta.html">Gogeta</a> and <a href="Vegito.html">Vegito</a>**,
the greatest threats to <a href="Merged_Zamasu.html">Merged Zamasu</a>
are slowly being neutralized.

<h2 id="intimate_connection">Intimate Connection</h2>
<p>One of Evil Victoria’s most disarming traits is the way she plays coy
in her encounters, making her partners feel as though they are the ones
in control. With <a href="Kefla.html">Kefla</a> (specifically Shy
Kefla), this dance of dominance and submission has become a repeating
ritual.</p>
<p>In one of their most telling moments, Evil Victoria leaned in for a
kiss and then pulled back, her silver eyes glowing faintly with playful
restraint. Kefla, burning with both passion and frustration, began
climbing up Evil Victoria’s legs, desperate to continue the embrace.
Evil Victoria stalled her for a heartbeat, teasingly whispering that she
would only give Kefla what she wanted if Kefla promised to protect her.
Without hesitation, Kefla agreed — a vow spoken in the heat of
desire.</p>
<p>Kefla then mounted her, taking what she craved, while Evil Victoria
reclined back with calculated softness, pretending to be overtaken and
whispering pleas for gentleness. The intimacy blurred the line between
manipulation and tenderness, each touch binding Kefla’s loyalty tighter.
When the passion ebbed, both women lay together on the couch, asleep —
Evil Victoria content, and Kefla unknowingly even more addicted to the
bond.</p>
<h2 id="recent_events">Recent Events</h2>
<ul>
<li>During a crystal raid, Evil Victoria fought alongside
<a href="Goku.html">Goku</a> instead of against him, protecting him and
his allies. This built trust between them and planted hesitation in
Goku’s heart — making him less likely to go all-out against her in the
future.</li>
<li>Through repeated intimacy and manipulation, Evil Victoria fully
secured <a href="Shy_Kefla.html">Shy Kefla</a>’s loyalty. By resetting
her Potara fusion limit during their encounters, she ensured Kefla would
remain bound to her influence. This effectively removed the threat of
Kefla as a dangerous, uncontrolled fusion warrior.</li>
<li>Shy Kefla has now become Evil Victoria’s most dangerous weapon.
Grateful for the intimate release Victoria has given her, Kefla fights
with unwavering loyalty, protecting Victoria at all costs.</li>
<li>Her growing closeness with <a href="Goku.html">Goku</a> mirrors
<a href="Victoria_Black.html">Victoria Black</a>’s bond with
<a href="Vegeta.html">Vegeta</a>. With Goku and Vegeta both compromised
— one emotionally softened by Evil Victoria, the other tied by history
to Victoria Black — the chance of them forming
<a href="Vegito.html">Vegito</a> or <a href="Gogeta.html">Gogeta</a> is
greatly diminished.</li>
<li>Evil Victoria’s mission of eliminating the fusion threats to
<a href="Merged_Zamasu.html">Merged Zamasu</a> is showing progress:
Kefla subdued, Vegito weakened by hesitation, and Gogeta increasingly
unlikely with Goku and Vegeta divided in loyalty.</li>
</ul>
<p>=== Tough Fight at a Bad Time</p>
<p>During a rooftop encounter, Evil Victoria was interrupted while
indulging with Shy Kefla by the arrival of
<a href="Harmony.html">Harmony</a> and <a href="Binary.html">Binary</a>.
Annoyed at the timing, EV prepared to fight, only for Kefla to lash out
first in fury. Kefla charged at Binary, knocking her far into the
distance, and the two began their own battle. This left Evil Victoria
facing Harmony, who attempted to keep her distance.</p>
<p>EV pressed the advantage, teleporting in front of Harmony to shove
her back, then sliding low behind her to trip her with her legs. Harmony
stumbled, only to be struck by EV’s delayed homing blasts. Before EV
could finish her, a torrent of fire interrupted —
<a href="Goddess_of_Destruction_Vanessa.html">Goddess of Destruction
Vanessa</a> had arrived, fast and fierce.</p>
<p>EV smirked as Vanessa challenged her: “Oh, so you’re Vanessa, the
fast one, huh?” Vanessa’s speed overwhelmed her, forcing EV on the
defensive. Vanessa slammed EV with her <strong>Power Wall</strong> of
fire, then charged a <strong>Prominence Blast</strong>. Though EV
regenerated quickly, Vanessa began to tire, unable to end the fight.</p>
<h3 id="prism_containment_trap">Prism Containment Trap</h3>
<p>Seizing an opening, Evil Victoria snapped her <strong>Dark Ki
Chains</strong> at Vanessa, binding her and yanking her close. “I guess
speed isn’t everything, is it?” EV taunted, before sending her
<strong>Horizontal Lightning of Absolution</strong> surging through the
chain, electrocuting Vanessa.</p>
<p>Harmony used the distraction to activate her experimental
<strong>Prism Containment Unit</strong>. Triangular beams rose around
EV, forming crystalline walls designed to trap her. EV only smirked,
mocking Harmony: “Nice trick, little one…”</p>
<p>Before the trap could seal completely, Shy Kefla flew in, blasting
the crystal walls apart and shorting the device. But this left her wide
open.</p>
<h3 id="binarys_decisive_blow">Binary’s Decisive Blow</h3>
<p>Taking advantage of the distraction, Binary struck with full force,
her attack smashing into Kefla and sending her rocketing across the
battlefield. Kefla crashed violently into a mountainside, far from the
others.</p>
<p>Hovering above her fallen opponent, Binary smirked: “That was a good
fight… but I’m done playing with you.” She ignited in a red aura,
powering up to unleash a cataclysmic explosion.</p>
<h3 id="the_growing_inferno">The Growing Inferno</h3>
<p>From a distance, Evil Victoria, Vanessa, and Harmony felt the
shockwaves and scorching heat radiating from Binary’s expanding
blast.</p>
<ul>
<li>EV demanded: “What the hell is going on over there?!”</li>
<li>Harmony smirked knowingly.</li>
<li>Vanessa added with cruel sarcasm: “Looks like the end of your sex
toy…”</li>
</ul>
<p>Realizing what was happening, Evil Victoria’s expression snapped.
“No!!” she screamed, elbowing Harmony aside and pushing off Vanessa. She
blasted herself free, flying headlong into Binary’s growing explosion to
reach Shy Kefla.</p>
<p>Vanessa quickly created a barrier around herself and Harmony. “Stay
here,” she ordered, as the two watched Evil Victoria vanish into the
crimson inferno, chasing after her lover.</p>
<ul>
<li>As Binary unleashed a cataclysmic explosion that threatened to
annihilate everything, Evil Victoria abandoned her fight with
<a href="Goddess_of_Destruction_Vanessa.html">Vanessa</a> and
<a href="Harmony.html">Harmony</a> to save <strong>Shy
Kefla</strong>.</li>
<li>Using her <strong>Dark Ki Chains</strong>, she attached to Kefla and
zipped directly into Binary’s explosion, sustaining heavy damage
herself.</li>
<li>Inside the explosion, she created her <strong>Shadow
Barrier</strong>, shielding Kefla while simultaneously healing herself.
To prolong Kefla’s survival, she kissed her, using her <strong>Fusion
Reset Kiss</strong> to extend Kefla’s time as a fusion. This came at
great personal cost, as her barrier began to shatter under the
continuous force.</li>
<li>On the verge of collapse, Evil Victoria cried out to <strong>Merged
Zamasu</strong>, who answered immediately. A divine energy beam restored
her health and energy to near perfection.</li>
<li>With renewed strength, she enveloped Kefla in her barrier and
escaped the explosion. Meanwhile, Vanessa and Harmony were forced to
remain under Vanessa’s protection, unable to intervene.</li>
<li>Harmony telepathically alerted her mother,
<a href="Victoria_Black.html">Victoria Black</a>, about the danger of
the growing blast. Victoria Black managed to contact Binary, convincing
her to stop before the explosion consumed everything — preventing a
repeat of the Gas Mask Clan’s planetary destruction.</li>
</ul>
<p>This moment solidified Evil Victoria’s image as both a
<strong>fearsome dark immortal</strong> and a <strong>tragic, conflicted
lover</strong>, torn between her service to Zamasu and her genuine
affection for Shy Kefla.</p>
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
