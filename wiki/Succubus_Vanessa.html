<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Succubus Vanessa</strong> is one of
<a href="Vanessa.html">Vanessa</a>’s alter egos — the extreme embodiment
of her unfulfilled personal desires, awakened through demonic energy.
She is a seductive, dangerous predator who seeks out powerful male
warriors across <a href="Conton_City.html">Conton City</a> to enslave
and use as living shields and trophies.</p>
<h2 id="appearance">Appearance</h2>

expression</li>
<li>**Skin:** Light brown with a soft warm undertone</li>

upper thighs</li>
<li>Gold wrist cuffs</li>
<li>Sexy white flats with light blue soles</li>

<li>**Aura:** Surrounded by playful pinkish hearts and small floating
ghost-like Majin minions that orbit her, enhancing her otherworldly
aura</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="personality">Personality</h2>
<ul>
<li>Flirtatious, theatrical, and proud</li>
<li>Easily bored, always seeking stronger prey</li>
<li>Clumsy at times, but becomes extremely focused when challenged</li>
<li>Arrogant — assumes her enslaved “cast” will do all her fighting for
her</li>
<li>If they fail, she angrily discards or punishes them</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="powers_and_abilities">Powers and Abilities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seductive Aura</strong> – Lowers targets’ guard, distracting
them</li>
<li><strong>Possession</strong> – Can take over opponents’ bodies (e.g.
<a href="Cooler.html">Cooler</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Soul-Link Curse</strong> – Once defeated, She will mount the
enemy, riding him into a bond with her while she delivers her cursed
chant, to the built-in tune that is the chorus of Janet Jackson’s Truly
song:</li>
</ul>
<p><code> * If she feels pain, they feel it</code><br />
<code> * If she dies, they die permanently — she revives due to her immortality</code><br />
<code> * This forces her victims to protect her at all costs</code></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced Speed</strong> – Normally her strongest advantage,
allowing hit-and-run tactics</li>
<li><strong>Energy Drain</strong> – Steals stamina and ki from linked
victims to empower herself</li>
<li><strong>Combat Adaptation</strong> – Grows stronger the longer she
toys with an opponent</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ghost_minions">Ghost Minions</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Spectral Servants:** Succubus Vanessa is constantly surrounded by
a swarm of spectral ghosts of varying sizes that float around her
body.</li>
<li>**Telepathic Control:** The ghosts obey her through telepathy,
reacting instantly to her thoughts and desires.</li>
<li>**Infinite Summoning:** She can summon an unlimited number of them
at will.</li>
<li>**Contact Detonation:**
<ul>
<li>Small Ghosts – Fast, relentless, and constantly track their target
until they collide and detonate. Their explosions cause light damage but
are difficult to evade due to their speed.</li>
<li>Large Ghosts – Slower and more visible, but their explosions deal
heavy damage and disrupt enemy attacks or guard attempts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>**Signature Attack — Phantom Burst:**</li>
</ul>
<p><code> # She summons a large tracking purple energy orb.  </code><br />
<code> # When the orb contacts its target, it initiates a delayed explosion process that causes continuous damage over several seconds.  </code><br />
<code> # At the start of the explosion phase, she summons 5 of her largest ghosts, which dive at the victim one after another.  </code><br />
<code> # If all 4–5 hit, the damage is devastating and almost always fatal.  </code><br />
<code> # However, if the victim survives, it means they are powerful enough to be “worthy” — and she will spare them… only to begin her binding ritual on their weakened body.  </code></p>
<p>The ghosts also defend her during her ritual, circling her body and
attacking anyone who approaches. If she is injured during the ritual,
the ghosts become enraged and launch at her attacker until they are
destroyed.</p>
<h2 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Overconfident in her slaves’ strength, rarely fights seriously until
forced</li>
<li>Easily distracted by lust and spectacle</li>
<li>When alone, struggles against coordinated groups</li>
<li>Link curse can be broken if her victim willingly rejects her, though
this is rare</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lore">Lore</h2>
<h3 id="origins">Origins</h3>
<p>Succubus Vanessa was born as an alter ego from the depths of
Vanessa’s unfulfilled personal desires. The persona grew stronger
through demonic ki, taking shape as a seductive predator that thrives on
conquest.</p>
<h3 id="the_rose_goku_black_incident">The Rose Goku Black Incident</h3>
<p>Her first cast member was <a href="Goku_Black_-Rose.html">Goku Black
(Rose)</a>. Believing his godly speeches, Vanessa flaunted him as her
ultimate protector. However, without his scythe, Rose underperformed,
failing to stop the hero patrollers. Vanessa was furious as she was
overrun and manhandled, realizing she still had to fend for herself. She
swore vengeance, deciding to take many more men to serve as her living
defense, and promised Rose that he would suffer as she expanded her
“cast.”</p>
<h3 id="the_cooler_incident">The Cooler Incident</h3>
<p>Seeking a stronger slave, Vanessa next targeted
<a href="Cooler.html">Cooler</a>. She encountered him while consoling
her latest victim and ambushed him. Despite her speed, Cooler proved
even faster, forcing her into a frantic chase. Cooler narrowly escaped
her possession attempts, humiliating her. This incident showed her
growing desperation to build a reliable roster of enslaved
protectors.</p>
<h3 id="the_broly_incident">The Broly Incident</h3>
<p>While wandering <a href="Conton_City.html">Conton City</a>, she found
a massive modified <a href="Broly.html">Broly</a>. Instantly obsessed,
she hypnotized and enslaved him, declaring:</p>
<ul>
<li>“I have taken a part in your being inside me. Now you will be one of
my slaves.”</li>
<li>“If I get hurt, you’ll share my pain. If I should die, you will die.
However, I myself will return to life.”</li>
</ul>
<p>She proudly called him her “boyfriend” and took him into battle as
her trophy. However, the “Walmart Broly” performed terribly, leaving her
screaming with frustration. Disgusted, she abandoned him, vowing to seek
stronger prey.</p>
<h3 id="the_hit_incident">The Hit Incident</h3>
<p>.
<img src="../images/Succubus_Vanessa_performing_Bonding_Hit_%21%21%21_.jpg" alt="Succubus_Vanessa_performing_Bonding_Hit_!!!_"/>
In a dramatic PvP confrontation, Vanessa targeted the legendary assassin
**Hit**, unleashing her signature **Soul-Link Curse** to bind him as an
unwilling protector. Though the binding succeeded — making Hit the
metaphysical safety net for any lethal blow — he proved absurdly inept
at guarding her. Most of the time, he merely stood idly with his hands
in his pockets, only reacting when **someone attacked him directly**. As
a result, Vanessa had to fend for herself much of the time, turning what
should’ve been a tactical advantage into a comedy of errors.</p>
<p>This incident underscores the flaw in Vanessa’s concept of “perfect
slaves”: even if a binding is successful, the bound target’s competence
(or lack thereof) can dramatically affect how useful they are. The Hit
Incident highlights the tension between her power and the absurd,
unpredictable behavior of mortal allies.</p>
<ul>
<li>First appearance: “Vanessa takes Hit – Xenoverse 2 PvP short”</li>
<li>Role: Bound protector (ineffective in practice)</li>
<li>Status: Active (unless broken in future lore)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the_binding_ritual_18_true_version">The Binding Ritual (+18 True
version)</h3>
<p>When she performs her soul-binding ritual, the victim must be
defeated or too weak to resist. As soon as he locks eyes with her, the
**screen begins swirling**, pulling the world inward toward her glowing
red eyes. The **chorus of <a href="Janet_Jackson.html">Janet
Jackson</a>’s “<a href="Truly.html">Truly</a>”** begins to play softly
in the background, specifically the part where she sings:</p>
<p>&gt; “…so crazy ’bout you, you… &gt; wanna get away with you,
you…”</p>
<p>As the music plays, she climbs onto him and begins riding him while
holding unwavering eye contact. Without blinking or breaking her stare,
she recites the incantation in sync with her movements:</p>
<p>&gt; **“I have taken a part in your being inside me. &gt; Now you
will be one of my slaves. &gt; You will obey and protect me. &gt; If I
get hurt, you'll share my pain. &gt; If I should die, you will die. &gt;
However, I myself will return to life.”**</p>
<p>At climax, a burst of purple light engulfs them. The swirl fades, and
the song cuts off mid-line as the soul-link seals. If interrupted before
completion, the swirl and music stop abruptly, and her eyes dim back to
normal, leaving her enraged and disoriented.</p>
<p>During this entire ritual, her ghosts circle her, creating a
perimeter and detonating on any attacker to protect their mistress until
the binding is complete.</p>
