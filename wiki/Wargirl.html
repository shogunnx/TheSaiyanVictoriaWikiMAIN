<b>Wargirl</b> is the youngest of the three Victoria sisters. Once known as <b>The Pretty Wargirl</b>, she has transformed from a reckless, approval-seeking fighter into a stylish and feared powerhouse whose elegance hides terrifying strength.  
</p><p>She is secretly defined by two forces:  
her fear of losing her body — and her love for the sister who will never let her go.

</p><p>Her first real job was as a waitress at the <span class="new" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvQ29udG9uX0NpdHlfQ2x1Yj9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=" title="Conton City Club (page does not exist)">Conton City Club</span>, a red-and-yellow bar in the business district.

<p>Determined to prove herself, Wargirl began secretly training.

She was found and revived by <a href="/wiki/Veronica" title="Veronica">Veronica</a>, a human fighter wielding a science-powered suit and purple electric gauntlets.  
</p><p>It was the first time anyone outside the sisters had risked their life to save her.  
Veronica’s courage stunned her, though Wargirl slipped away — never realizing Veronica had quietly fallen in love with her.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Night_Victoria_Black_Needed_Her">The Night Victoria Black Needed Her</span></h2>
<p>After <span class="new" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvVHVybGVzP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==" title="Turles (page does not exist)">Turles</span>’ death, <a href="/wiki/Victoria_Chaser" title="Victoria Chaser">Victoria Chaser</a> retired from combat to become an attorney, leaving <strong class="mw-selflink selflink">Wargirl</strong> as the family’s main PvP fighter. Wargirl embraced the responsibility without hesitation, carrying their reputation and protecting <a href="/wiki/Harmony" title="Harmony">Harmony</a> as if she were blood.  
</p><p>During this time, Wargirl noticed something changing in <a href="/wiki/Victoria_Black" title="Victoria Black">Victoria Black</a>. Black was always radiant, confident, and commanding—but she began to seem lonely. Her smiles grew forced, her laughter thin. She would linger near Wargirl, then pull away, pretending nothing was wrong.  
</p><p>Wargirl grew worried. When she pressed for answers, Black brushed her off, then quietly cried where she knew Wargirl could hear. Finally, Wargirl cornered her in private and demanded to know what was wrong.  
</p><p>Black turned to her with tears in her eyes and whispered:  
</p>
<dl><dd><i>“I just… I just really need someone right now but…"</i></dd></dl>
<p>Wargirl pushed further, and Black looked straight into her eyes and confessed:  
</p>
<dl><dd><i>“I… I need you.”</i></dd></dl>
<p>She pulled Wargirl into a trembling kiss.  
Wargirl froze. She didn’t know what to do—this was her older sister, her leader. But Black’s eyes were full of pain, and her voice shook as she pleaded:  
</p>
<dl><dd><i>“Please… I’m so alone.”</i></dd></dl>
<p>Something inside Wargirl broke. Her instinct to protect her overrode everything else. She kissed her back, not as a tease but as if trying to hold her together. Black whispered her loneliness, her despair, and her longing to feel good again. Slowly, she guided Wargirl down, trembling and tearful.  
</p><p>Wargirl didn’t resist. She understood. Victoria Black had spent years sacrificing her own happiness to protect everyone else. If this was what she needed to finally rest, then Wargirl would be the one to give it to her.  
</p><p>SSJ3 Wargirl is extremely good in this area. Her dense muscle and tight body allows her to become almost immovable for Victoria Black. That's exactly what drives Black so crazy about her. Wargirl's intense passion to please, combined with the sheer skill of her tongue was easily enough to overwhelm Victoria, a woman who generally hides her intimate desires and neglects herself the benefits of a man. As for SSJ3 Wargirl, she loves fiercely. Once you've gotten her heart to agree on something, she's not going to stop until she feels she is satisfied with the results. Overpowered, Victoria Black shortly succumbed to the overload of full body releases from Wargirl's efforts. She passed out, still in SSJ3 Wargirl's mouth,  tears still on her cheeks.  
Wargirl carried her to bed, then sat at the foot of it, staring in silence, mind spinning. She had protected Victoria Black a thousand times—but never like this. The stress of it all finally hit her, and she fell asleep there at the foot of the bed.  
</p><p><b>Significance:</b>
</p>
<ul><li>Wargirl secretly became Victoria Black’s source of comfort and release.</li>
<li>According to Victoria Black, nothing she's ever felt compares to the skill SSJ3 Wargirl possess intimately.</li>
<li>This event explains why Wargirl often shields Victoria Black from others, even off the battlefield.</li>
<li>It marks the start of a complicated hidden bond between them that quietly influences all of Wargirl’s later decisions.</li></ul>

<p>Before the kidnapping, Wargirl sometimes comforted Victoria Black during her depressive spells.  
These moments were soft, physical, and framed as emotional support — but secretly intimate.  
</p><p>After Chaser’s death, Victoria Black became <b>possessive</b>.  
She feared losing Wargirl too and decided if she could give her <b>everything</b> — emotionally and physically — she would never wander into danger again.
</p><p>At first, Wargirl submitted out of guilt. Then she became used to it.  
Then she began <b>loving it.</b>
</p>
<ul><li>In her SSJ3 form, Wargirl is a <b>dominant lover</b>.</li>
<li>Victoria, usually the strongest in any room, <b>submits to her younger sister</b> — enjoying the safety of surrendering to her.</li>
<li>Wargirl gets to <b>vent her frustration</b> and <b>feel valued</b>, while Victoria gets the <b>mind-breaking release</b> she craves.</li>
<li>Victoria has not been with a man in years, addicted to the release only Wargirl brings.</li></ul>
<p>Wargirl sometimes pushes her away when not in the mood, but never leaves — afraid if she did, she would lose the only person who loves her this completely.  
Victoria would burn the universe before letting anyone else have her.  
This bond is now the <b>greatest obstacle to <a href="/wiki/Veronica" title="Veronica">Veronica</a>’s dream</b> of being with Wargirl.

<p>Wargirl’s fighting style is defined by one buried trauma:
</p><p>&gt; She is terrified of losing her beautiful body to bodychangers.

<li><i>Are all Body Changers weird like this?</i></li></ul>
<p>Though she dodged every attempt, the fear scarred her.  
Since then, she’s become <b>cold and lethal</b> toward any enemy with possession, parasitic, or body-stealing powers.  
She fights with <b>speed, agility, and instant-kill aggression</b>, refusing to let anyone even touch her.
