<p><strong>Wargirl</strong> is the youngest of the three Victoria
sisters. Once known as <strong>The Pretty Wargirl</strong>, she has
transformed from a reckless, approval-seeking fighter into a stylish and
feared powerhouse whose elegance hides terrifying strength.</p>
<p>She is secretly defined by two forces: her fear of losing her body —
and her love for the sister who will never let her go.</p>
<h2 id="origins">🌱 Origins</h2>
<p>Wargirl was born after <a href="Victoria_Chaser.html">Victoria
Chaser</a> and <a href="Victoria_Black.html">Victoria Black</a>, often
treated as the impulsive baby of the family. While her sisters rose
quickly through the <a href="Time_Patrol.html">Time Patrol</a>, she
struggled with discipline and spent more time styling outfits than
running missions.</p>
<p>Her first real job was as a waitress at the
<a href="Conton_City_Club.html">Conton City Club</a>, a red-and-yellow
bar in the business district. Known more for her beauty and playful
energy than her combat record, she quietly resented being seen as
ornamental.</p>
<h2 id="rise_as_the_pretty_wargirl">⚔️ Rise as The Pretty Wargirl</h2>
<p>Determined to prove herself, Wargirl began secretly training. She
fought <a href="Majin_Buu.html">Majin Buu</a> alone and barely survived,
then targeted <a href="Turles.html">Turles</a>.</p>
<p>Knowing she couldn’t win head-on, she and
<a href="Harmony.html">Harmony</a>, <a href="Goten.html">Goten</a>, and
<a href="Kid_Trunks.html">Kid Trunks</a> staged an
<strong>ambush</strong>. Harmony distracted him while Wargirl struck
from behind, unleashing a decisive burst of power that ended the fight.
It shocked the entire patrol and marked her arrival as <strong>The
Pretty Wargirl</strong> — beautiful, bold, and brutally effective.</p>
<h2 id="the_broly_raid_veronicas_entrance">💔 The Broly Raid —
Veronica’s Entrance</h2>
<p>During the <a href="Broly.html">Broly</a> raid, The Pretty Wargirl
underestimated him and was blasted across the battlefield, left gravely
injured. She was found and revived by
<a href="Veronica.html">Veronica</a>, a human fighter wielding a
science-powered suit and purple electric gauntlets.</p>
<p>It was the first time anyone outside the sisters had risked their
life to save her. Veronica’s courage stunned her, though Wargirl slipped
away — never realizing Veronica had quietly fallen in love with her.</p>
<h2 id="the_night_victoria_black_needed_her">The Night Victoria Black
Needed Her</h2>
<p>After <a href="Turles.html">Turles</a>’ death,
<a href="Victoria_Chaser.html">Victoria Chaser</a> retired from combat
to become an attorney, leaving <a href="Wargirl.html">Wargirl</a> as the
family’s main PvP fighter. Wargirl embraced the responsibility without
hesitation, carrying their reputation and protecting
<a href="Harmony.html">Harmony</a> as if she were blood.</p>
<p>During this time, Wargirl noticed something changing in
<a href="Victoria_Black.html">Victoria Black</a>. Black was always
radiant, confident, and commanding—but she began to seem lonely. Her
smiles grew forced, her laughter thin. She would linger near Wargirl,
then pull away, pretending nothing was wrong.</p>
<p>Wargirl grew worried. When she pressed for answers, Black brushed her
off, then quietly cried where she knew Wargirl could hear. Finally,
Wargirl cornered her in private and demanded to know what was wrong.</p>
<p>Black turned to her with tears in her eyes and whispered:</p>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
<em>“I just… I just really need someone right now but…”</em>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Wargirl pushed further, and Black looked straight into her eyes and
confessed:</p>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
<em>“I… I need you.”</em>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>She pulled Wargirl into a trembling kiss. Wargirl froze. She didn’t
know what to do—this was her older sister, her leader. But Black’s eyes
were full of pain, and her voice shook as she pleaded:</p>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
<em>“Please… I’m so alone.”</em>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Something inside Wargirl broke. Her instinct to protect her overrode
everything else. She kissed her back, not as a tease but as if trying to
hold her together. Black whispered her loneliness, her despair, and her
longing to feel good again. Slowly, she guided Wargirl down, trembling
and tearful.</p>
<p>Wargirl didn’t resist. She understood. Victoria Black had spent years
sacrificing her own happiness to protect everyone else. If this was what
she needed to finally rest, then Wargirl would be the one to give it to
her.</p>
<p>Black passed out from the release, tears still on her cheeks. Wargirl
carried her to bed, then sat at the foot of it, staring in silence, mind
spinning. She had protected Victoria Black a thousand times—but never
like this. The stress of it all finally hit her, and she fell asleep
there at the foot of the bed.</p>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wargirl secretly became Victoria Black’s source of comfort and
release.</li>
<li>This event explains why Wargirl often shields Victoria Black from
others, even off the battlefield.</li>
<li>It marks the start of a complicated hidden bond between them that
quietly influences all of Wargirl’s later decisions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="kidnapping_chasers_death">⚰️ Kidnapping &amp; Chaser’s
Death</h2>
<p>Not long after, while walking home from work, Wargirl was kidnapped
by the Gas Mask Clan. <a href="Harmony.html">Harmony</a>,
<a href="Goten.html">Goten</a> and <a href="Kid_Trunks.html">Kid
Trunks</a> tracked her to their lair. Harmony carried her while Gotenks
fought to protect them, but they were surrounded — until
<a href="Victoria_Chaser.html">Victoria Chaser</a> arrived.</p>
<p>Chaser sacrificed her life to save Wargirl.
<a href="Victoria_Black.html">Victoria Black</a> and
<a href="Binary.html">Binary</a> later annihilated the entire clan and
their planet in retaliation.</p>
<h2 id="the_secret_bond_with_victoria_black">💞 The Secret Bond with
Victoria Black</h2>
<p>Before the kidnapping, Wargirl sometimes comforted Victoria Black
during her depressive spells. These moments were soft, physical, and
framed as emotional support — but secretly intimate.</p>
<p>After Chaser’s death, Victoria Black became
<strong>possessive</strong>. She feared losing Wargirl too and decided
if she could give her <strong>everything</strong> — emotionally and
physically — she would never wander into danger again.</p>
<p>At first, Wargirl submitted out of guilt. Then she became used to it.
Then she began <strong>loving it.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In her SSJ3 form, Wargirl is a <strong>dominant lover</strong>.</li>
<li>Victoria, usually the strongest in any room, <strong>submits to her
younger sister</strong> — enjoying the safety of surrendering to
her.</li>
<li>Wargirl gets to <strong>vent her frustration</strong> and
<strong>feel valued</strong>, while Victoria gets the
<strong>mind-breaking release</strong> she craves.</li>
<li>Victoria has not been with a man in years, addicted to the release
only Wargirl brings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wargirl sometimes pushes her away when not in the mood, but never
leaves — afraid if she did, she would lose the only person who loves her
this completely. Victoria would burn the universe before letting anyone
else have her. This bond is now the <strong>greatest obstacle to
<a href="Veronica.html">Veronica</a>’s dream</strong> of being with
Wargirl.</p>
<h2 id="the_portal_first_to_enter_the_marvel_universe">🌌 The Portal —
First to Enter the <a href="Marvel_Universe.html">Marvel
Universe</a></h2>
<p>After the kidnapping and Chaser’s death, Wargirl trained
relentlessly, becoming restless with the limits of the
<a href="Time_Patrol.html">Time Patrol</a>.
<a href="Harmony.html">Harmony</a> had been secretly modifying her
experimental transporter door to breach entire realities, and
<a href="Binary.html">Binary</a> was arguing to be the first to use
it.</p>
<p>But when Harmony stepped away and Binary got dragged off to train
with <a href="Victoria_Black.html">Victoria Black</a>, Wargirl seized
her chance.</p>
<p>While watching her idol <a href="Captain_Marvel.html">Captain
Marvel</a> on TV, Wargirl smiled, slipped on her gold
<a href="Yves_Saint_Laurent.html">YSL</a> heels, grabbed her white YSL
purse, and <strong>charged through the portal.</strong> She became the
first of the Victoria Sisters — and the first Time Patroller — to enter
the Marvel Universe.</p>
<p>There, she immediately drew the attention of
<a href="Ms._Marvel.html">Ms. Marvel</a>’s team and later clashed with
<a href="Doctor_Strange.html">Doctor Strange</a> in a reality-warping
battle — marking her as a multiversal fighter.</p>
<h2 id="combat_psychology_the_ginyu_trauma">🩸 Combat Psychology — The
Ginyu Trauma</h2>
<p>Wargirl’s fighting style is defined by one buried trauma:</p>
<p>&gt; She is terrified of losing her beautiful body to
bodychangers.</p>
<p>During the <a href="Ginyu_Force.html">Ginyu Force</a> raids,
<a href="Ginyu.html">Ginyu</a> targeted her body specifically — praising
its "perfection" and attempting <strong>Body Change</strong> multiple
times:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Captain Ginyu Is Stopped From Stealing Wargirl</em></li>
<li><em>The COM stops Captain Ginyu From Stealing Wargirl</em></li>
<li><em>Are all Body Changers weird like this?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Though she dodged every attempt, the fear scarred her. Since then,
she’s become <strong>cold and lethal</strong> toward any enemy with
possession, parasitic, or body-stealing powers. She fights with
<strong>speed, agility, and instant-kill aggression</strong>, refusing
to let anyone even touch her.</p>
<p>Even <a href="Victoria_Black.html">Victoria Black</a> watches her
closely during these fights, knowing how deeply they shake her.</p>
<h2 id="public_slip_ups">💋 Public Slip-Ups</h2>
<p>Their private bond sometimes leaks through. After SSJ3 Wargirl
defeated <a href="Shaggy.html">Shaggy</a>, Victoria visited the
<a href="Conton_City_Club.html">Conton City Club</a> to congratulate
her. She gripped Wargirl’s waist from behind and whispered "good job"…
with her fingers slipping under Wargirl’s high-rise, low-waisted
shorts.</p>
<p>Wargirl escaped only when a news alert reported
<a href="Hit.html">Hit</a> attacking the
<a href="Red_Ribbon_Army.html">Red Ribbon Army</a> facility. As Victoria
left, she teased, &gt; "I’ll be needing your help to sleep tonight."</p>
<p>Everyone heard. Everyone knew. Wargirl was mortified — and secretly
flattered.</p>
<h2 id="present_day_ssj3_wargirl">🌟 Present Day — SSJ3 Wargirl</h2>
<p>Wargirl has fully shed her "Pretty Wargirl" persona. She is now
<strong>SSJ3 Wargirl</strong>: powerful, precise, feared, and impossibly
fast. She balances her time bartending and hosting at the
<a href="Conton_City_Club.html">Conton City Club</a> while serving as
one of the strongest female Saiyans in the multiverse.</p>
<h2 id="style_over_power_fashion_first">💅 Style Over Power — Fashion
First</h2>
<p>Few realize that Wargirl had already reached
<strong><a href="Super_Saiyan_God_Super_Saiyan.html">Super Saiyan God
Super Saiyan</a> (SSGSS)</strong> long ago, even while she was just a PQ
farmer. Her power level has long surpassed SSJ3 — but she chooses to
fight in SSJ3 form because it is <strong>fashionably desirable</strong>.
The flowing golden hair, dramatic aura, and wild silhouette amplify her
glamorous presence.</p>
<p><strong>Fashion is her main priority.</strong> She is rarely seen
without:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gold YSL heels (with the logo forming the heel structure)</li>
<li>A white YSL purse with pink edges and strap</li>
<li>Flawless makeup, polished nails, and perfectly styled hair</li>
</ul>
<p>For Wargirl, fighting isn’t just about winning — it’s about
<strong>being unforgettable.</strong></p>
