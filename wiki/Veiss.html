<h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>
<p>Years after the cast has escaped this future, Frieza Became the new
official God of Destruction by right. For even Beerus himself could not
quell the tyrant... The universe was his and his forever, and he made
this very clear to all inhabitants that his now Godly grip was on
everyones throats.. even deciding your afterlife.. Veiss's life was but
that of a humbled Gardner and teacher to his four sons in agriculture as
well a enthusiastic story teller of the many perils Namekians had
endured from disastrous natures to Saiyan foes of eld whom endangered
them time after time only to have been saved by the brave warriors to
lul his sons to sleep. Elder Kami slug was now the current ruler of New
namek forgoing his once evil ways to take the universe for himself to
maintain the peace.. yet the threat of pure calculated evil knows no
such rest. Resistence fell swiftly, the ominous winds escaping could not
carry them to safety this time.. All were captured within the hour
before frieza's arrival, and indeed, their was a hell to pay for.</p>
<p><strong>Coming of the hellhound</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Enslavement was not new to the namekians who had lived prior to now,
but the restlessness was made evident this time that no savior was
coming, yet under the orders of Dr. Myuu and his faction of Frieza
forces, they would cultivate all of nameks resources every year until
their dragonballs had fully recharged. Veiss never knowing shackles
before, observed his enemies keenly for any opportunity to exploit or a
weakness in their formation to run down. Elder slug reading Veiss easily
persists to him to not take their bait.. they would be more than happy
to shoot him dead for laughs. Veiss using his sensing felt the truth of
slugs wisdom, they were more than enough to slaughter everyone. Days to
weeks the many tribes of them began to wither from exhaustion, picking
apart once blue fields to utter wastelands for precious minerals,
fighting starvation, fatigue, wilter tools overused and even the
watchmen who delighted themselves on placing boot to heads before
shooting them coldly. Few did fight back with time, including his eldest
son Flu on the very day He met... him.</li>
</ul>
<p>Veiss's head cratered the ground he was pinned, forced to witness
frieza himself killing his kind in turns with death beams til he reached
flu. Veiss's eyes began to strain to the sight of such cruelty as frieza
used Hakai, deleting him entirely. his loss became a boon as his Warrior
instincts awoken, his power rising folds and his captors very leg snaps
like a twig, Veiss's rampage was clear.. He wants Justice.</p>
<p><strong>" Murderer!!! He was my Son!!! "</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Elder Slugs Sinister smile evident as he watched Veiss loss himself
to the frenzy, spurring the other Namekians to cheer as Veiss one after
the other took the lives of his oppressors, Adapting fast to the self he
thought no longer factored. As fast as his actions to defy arose, so to
was the reality of overwhelming might to his gutt being impaled by a
god. Yet he survived thanks to his remaining sons healing him. He felt
the change within his being stir, unfamiliar and yet so liberating.
Slugs laughter broke his euphoria, handing him a poach of water. Many
lessons were learned for Veiss, he was to new to fighting, yet he had
undeniable pain be his teacher. Slug was no longer doubtful of Veiss,
making his choice by fusing himself to veiss in order to survive whats
to come.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pilgrimage to the demonrealm</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With his remaining sons in two years time, a Darring escape from
Namek now a lifeless dessert made it more plausible to sneak past
friezas men to the escape pods. With barely a handful of Namekians alive
and nearing extinction, they no longer feared death. If it was to end,
let it end with even four to find a new home to start again. Rioting
loudly with what strengh they had left, did all they can to buy Veiss
and his sons the time they needed to get to a usable ship. Even Veiss
himself wailed in the assault, reaching closer to the ship of their
ideals, Veiss's second son ran ahead to operate it manually. Bodies both
Namekian and fearful loyalists piled behind, Veiss's family succeeds as
they make haste to go off planet as soon as possible, they all took a
last look at Namek through the screens in silence. Only the youngest
wept in heavy tears, as they now sailed the cosmos for refuge, had it
not been shortly lived. Alarms began blarring with the suddeness of
Friezas mothership coming into view, ready to fire at them on the spot.
Veiss's body moved on instict, to use himself to shield his children
from the coming blast as their very spacecraft becomes obliterated.
Veiss in this moment was utterly helpless as his beloved three become
dust to him, while he himself was the sturdier to the impact, yet the
pain he felt finally unlocked his dormant power to rare for a namekian
to have as his first rift swallows him whole before the Vaccume of space
could claim him.</li>
</ul>
<p>He did not begin his Journey on his feet in the demon realm, he
latched and crawled himself for hours on end. Broken entirely, Tears
finally falling down his cheeks, his Body cindered and wretched with
injuries, wounds, and gritting his teeth or force himself to bit his own
tongue to find shelter. Twenty malms was his limit before he blackout,
yet his very mind refuses to let him dream pleasently for the nightmares
have but begun, his once peaceful nature now in conflict to the Violent
nurture of Trauma, Grief and despair..</p>
<p><strong>Sparks of a wish</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Veiss finds himself in a demonistic inspired room with unfamiliar
maidens changing his very bandages and applying medicines to the burns
on his green flesh. Still in a daze with foggy eyes, he is unsure how to
speak to them, to tell them to stop mending his body. He knew nothing of
these lands, or its customs. No better a stranger in weird envisioned
paradise, so many questions swarmed Veiss's thoughts, Vulnerable to his
self reflections as he lays confortably in this luxorius room never
onced gazed. Struggling to get himself up, he felt the many hands trying
to stop him, only to push them all aside for much needed space. Shakily
Grabbing the large flower vase of water to drink, he gazed outside the
balcony to gain a wider perspective. Spitting out the fungus flower in
his mouth, his accute hearing picks up those approuching, the maids
pouting, leave like the flock of sirens that they were greet another.
The oldest Namekian in native tongue welcomes Veiss to the Kings Capital
of the realm. Veiss never knew of Neva, but knew enough that some
namekians never returned to namek after the first disaster. The two
shook hands, as both began a swift friendship that span for many years
with Veiss explaining the current crisis, and Neva teaching the still
young Namekian of their original home where only here does frieza's
influence ends but struggles remaining the sight to behold.</li>
</ul>
<p>Neva however was greatly saddened by the loss of their people once
more to turmoil outside their control, so much so he gathered his three
guardians holding the demon realms very dragonballs that he made so long
ago, making this a special case to aide Veiss and encourage him to
restore his people and namek. to Veiss.. wishing felt wrong now, for
even if he did make such a wish they would only be killed again or
worse. Before he could give solid reason, the dragons appearance came
and darkened the skies above, his arrival both mystical, majestic and a
sense of unbriddled power before his very eyes, as if for once he is
seeing himself in his eyes looking back. Stepping forward to the
collosal dragon before him without a shred of fear, in his native
tongue, Veiss screams out his wish.. to finally unleash all of his
latent potential. For this particular dragon to hear a warriors Call for
power, it was all to eager to fullfil his wish. As its entirety dances
to sky readying itself to disburst, it flung itself forward as well its
three dragonballs merging into Veiss as well itself, Veiss finds himself
engulfed once more, but this time now, he felt his true self, the
sleeping warrior become a Cataclysm of a universe ready to bend to his
will, Transforming the super Namekian into a Titan. The waves of power
oblitterated all of the demon realm in a blinding flash, with nothing
surviving it. His first steps made the grounds quake, His chi now his
Warcry, His purpose renewed as what was once kept away from him his
whole life was now his truly.</p>
<p><strong>" I... am sorry Neva, but peace was the first lesson I had to
unlearn, the rest I paid for was with great pains to stand here now.
"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Embodiment of all he Hates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>His Body wasn't the only pernament change made by his wish, his mind
now as sharp as his coil covered nails and his spirit fortified by his
relentless will. Even feeling the very space itself felt more natural,
like all it takes for him was a simple as stepping forward to where he
wants to go. Gazing upon his cuffs still on his wrists, he quickly
collected himself to remind himself of the terrible set backs that
transpired, harsh lessons and adopting needed cruelty. Shifting his
focus to the now destroyed castle in as well the once surrounding lands
now lifeless, he removes the broken debree easily with his rifts aside
to find what Neva spoke of throughout his time, Gomah's secret vault.
Prying the metal doors open was but a after thought, as he walks forward
into the darkness down, Veiss tore off his raggish shirt off of himself
to find a unique treasure only given to lords of the past. Raiding the
many treasures he founded since he already killed the realm with his
wish, he began to experiment with his space abilities. Using the royal
baggage that was among a pile of shiny gemstones, he converted the bag
into that of a small pocket dimension that only he can fully utilize,
and began his practices their in the Vault filled with Gomah's many
riches. Only stopping for when he spots his Iconic white coat. Hardly
carring for the glass casing surrounding it, putting it on was his way
of saying to himself that when he goes bad, I may as well have a bit of
fun doing it from time to time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before he began the climb upstairs, he found himself scratching at
his cuffs, as if it began to irratate him, his memories flood his
thoughts like a crashing tsunami. His sons... his people.. both elder
Slug and Neva who gave him this one and only chance.. but his worse
forbodding living just as freely in his head... Frieza.. causing Veiss
to feel his chest tighten, his fist clenching so hard they bleed, his
contorting face filling with malice as his laugh echoes.</p>
<p><strong>" If I'm to kill him.. I cannot do it now, simply
overpowering him is tedius. No.. I must practice his methods for myself,
if I'm to understand that monster, I must adopt his cruelty..

<h2 id="key_moments">Key Moments</h2>
<p><code>      ● Going to the past at long last ●</code></p>
<ul>
<li>After the complete destruction of the demon realm... again.. He is
founded by Fu. Though Veiss cares little for the chatter box of a demon,
he couldn't argue on how knowledgeful he was as he's taken to the
Xenoverse realm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Relunctantly thanks to Fu as well, he begins his Journey... by
blowing up key planets that will favor frieza in the future.</p>
<p><code>      ● Recruiting the tuffle twins of</code><br />
<code>        universe six ●</code></p>
<ul>
<li>still unsure of many things, he finds the tuffle planet that made
peace with the saiyans of universe six, Basking in the wonders he never
could have imagined since he travels between spaces. It was here he
stayed for a year to educate himself on the Zuno program, hilariously
being scolded by a hologram in high definition. Valuing all he came
across, he visited the agroculture labs to steal seeds as well three
trees of mights to solve a recurring problem he's been having. But his
greatest finds were the tuffle twins... Both Soven and Jedda who looked
to him now as their father. Much like a genocidal bandit with precious
loot, he steals a space fortress for himself to take with him to space
and blows up that planet entirely, his only reason was the smartass
hologram. ●</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="powers_and_abilities">Powers and Abilities</h3>
<p>• Bending space at will. = His most notible Ability with heavy
applications to how Veiss can use this to traverse freely in the
Universe. Even in battle he can redirect both physical and chi based
attacks back to their senders.</p>
<p>• Namekian Anatomy = as a Namekian or should the very last of his
Kind. He in nature already had</p>
<p><code>               ○ regeneration so long as his head remains intaked.</code><br />
<code>               ○ superhuman: Strength</code><br />
<code>                             Speed</code><br />
<code>                             Stamina</code><br />
<code>                             endurance</code><br />
<code>                             Hearing</code><br />
<code>               ○ Telepathy: rarely used by Veiss personally, but should a situation require cordination or a direct plan, he'll voice to whoever allows him to.</code><br />
<code>               ○ Arm Extention: Strechy arms.</code></p>
<p>● Shadow Crusher = his main counter to ki blasters by phasing into
the beam current to Strike at the users with full force to hit them
insanely Hard.</p>
<p>● Evil Blast = His Ace in his Arsonal of attacks by bending space on
himself to leave behind his Image to fool his opponents into a cunning
trap, then Blasting them with as much Darkness to either stun,
incapacitate or... Rarely kill should it become necessary.</p>
<p>● Last emperor = All he has ever learned from Black frieza during his
time as a slave as well the festering hatred and resent of his
experiences has accumulated his Ultimate attack that Turns all of his
Ability to bend space into one Ki free Beam Towards his foe with
everything he has, either at point blank or far, this attack is
painful.</p>
<h2 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h2>
<p>● Whistling... = Due to namekians sense of hearing being a hundred
folds more potent, the sharp sound is to a Namekian, the equivalent of a
million pins dropping all at once.</p>
<p>● Chi Exhaustion = Despite having a near universal ocean of Chi to
use to open rifts to bend space, it takes Quite a bit of power from him
to either maintain or even Stabilize rifts if his focus is for a moment
misplaced. Anything Much larger for transport like relocating a planet
forces Veiss to remain absolutely still while moving said object
safely.</p>
<p>● His inability to revert back to a normal Namekian warrior. = Since
he made his wish in the demon realm to unleash all of his Latent power
and in the process Destroying the future realm in Transition thanks to
the demon Dragon merging itself to Veiss. He cannot fully Maintain long
running Battles due to the power coat he exudes. This dangerous for him
for the simple fact that he hasn't adjusted to this body. He hasn't
discovered this weakness yet.</p>
<h2 id="key_relationships">Key Relationships</h2>
<p>● His four Sons He was proud to raise before his Life became a
hellish Struggle under the rule of God Frieza, In secret He misses them
more than any but will not speak of them or what the cost of power truly
took from this once simple Namekian</p>
<p><code>                   ○ Fluen : age 17 = Erased</code><br />
<code>                   ○ Viol. : age 13 = Dead</code><br />
<code>                   ○ bon.  : age  9 = dead</code><br />
<code>                   ○ Tuba. : age  5 = dead</code></p>
<p>● Elder Kami Slug</p>
<ul>
<li>Last of the Elders of Namek and even before then, A once feared
Conquerer of the western quadrant, or once was until his Major defeat to
Goku and his Allies forced the super namekian away from earth, returned
changed to enjoy his remaining days... Yet once Frieza's Army had
completly and hilariously enslaved the entire race, he sought out for
even one Namekian warrior to take the stand as well... fuse with said
Namekian to pass on all of his Evil Nature as his inheritance, to teach
in secret. Veiss was infact that student for his days of fighting has
long since left him entirely. Since then he has remained silent within
Veiss but feeds the evil he harbors while enjoying the battles in his
eyes.</li>
</ul>
<p>● Neva, Scholar of the demon realm.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oldest Namekian elder to have ever lived, he remained behind when
his people sought for thwir liberation outside. Only to then be told
that a Namekian has returned spur life to the elders legs to see a
barely alive veiss tended to by the royal Maids of lord Gomah. Once
Veiss explained that All there people have met extinction and Namek
uninhabbitable.. Neva's gentle heart Shattered, for he gave up
everything to save his people.. only to outlive them all. No longer
feeling compelled to serve the demon realm or its vile ruler, Neva
summons the taigomi with the demon realms Dragonballs for one final
Sacrifice.. with just enough Magic still within his veins, he disabled
the Guardians to allow Veiss to make the last wish... to hear his
peoples warcry, his raw emotion in their native tongue to have all his
Latent power be granted, Brought a smile to Neva before excepting the
very end of himself as well the realm he served for eons... rest well
neva, your finally with them.</li>
</ul>
<p>● Soven and Jedda</p>
<ul>
<li>Tuffle twins in the prototype phase. Veiss spent much time here to
learn many things of the ever expanding universe. These two weren't even
concious of yet of the world and yet even in their developmental state.
They felt Veiss, his power, his struggles, his mind fortifying on
knowledge he never knew. To them both in unison, they have called him
Father. Upon openong their young eyes to finally see the world, their
fist sight was indeed Veiss Carrying them both in his Arms as he laid
waste to the tuffle world with his simple eye beams, his rifts Dropping
meteors from the skies and Stealing The tuffle fortress where they call
home.</li>
</ul>
<p>● Soven is a shy and timid child and follower of Veiss. To him, Veiss
is a Hero, even if others disagree with his methods.</p>
<p>● Jedda Is the collective and bold tuffle child who learns as much
from their adoptive Father. He Knows that once he and soven find a host
either dead or alive, they would finally begin their operation into full
swing.</p>
<p>● Sweety</p>
<ul>
<li>His very first Attempt to take the timescroll that contained his and
the casts very history, ended with him Against Sweety, Pumpikon and
Gubber in a fight he would have easily won with the crippled Gubber
beneath his foot, Pumpikon fighting off Cell max that he opened a rift
for to deal with the brash Saiyan woman and sweety. Yet he completly
underestimated Just how power she can truly be when she fights without
her Limits in check. In the end of this confrontation, no one really won
here. Gubber retires, Pumpikon Selflessly Dies to stop cell Max and
sweety weeps. Yet Veiss retrieves Pumpikons corpse for soven to take
host of, all her power, her memories and perhaps her spirit now trapped
in the dense layers of systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>● Wargirl: Has yet to encounter her in any related stories....
Yet</p>
<p>● Victoria Black:</p>
<ul>
<li>They have not met officially but after much time in his recovery as
well sparrings with soven Now Pumpikon. He is even more powerful now but
much more cautious this time patrollers like sweety, doing a thorough
search for any real threats to himself. His eyes catching victoria Black
in secret calls upon the tufflized saiyan to observe and report
everything pertaining.</li>
</ul>
<p>● Vanessa: Has yet to encounter her in any related stories... yet</p>
<p>● Harmony: Has yet to encounter her in any related stories... yet</p>
<p>●Binary: Has yet to encounter her in any related stories... yet.</p>
<h2 id="notable_moments">Notable Moments</h2>
<p>● Surviving Impalement by black frieza himself, all the while
Fighting back against far stronger opponents and killing them to Avenge
his son.. who was tragically erased by Frieza's Hakai.</p>
<p>● Leading the last tribe of living Namekians remaining on a now
lifeless Namek to Escape. Veiss first success in displaying his tactics
only to have frieza's mothership Firing their main Cannon.. obliterating
the very ship, as well his remaining sons</p>
<p>● His first rift created in the midst of his life ending, bending
Space just enough to escape Death. Yet as he Crawled across the demon
realm on his belly due to the severity of the numerous injurys, he still
had enough will power to Keep going.</p>
<p>● His Wish:</p>
<ul>
<li>Befriending Neva of the demon realm, Veiss told his Tale, spent a
decade their to learn, recover, Train Himself to hone his battle
instincts enough to defend himself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet by Nevas own Actions, he called the taigomi to a remote location
to disable them to use the Demon realms Dragonballs for one last time.
Although Veiss was already a super namekian at this point in his life,
he in his peoples Tongue made his warcry know within his wish to Avenge
his people, to Unlock all of his latent potential power for the fight to
come. A easy wish for the dragon sure.. but after hearing a Young
warriors need for power the Demon dragon as well the three dragonballs
become one with Veiss in a display of unimaginable power, enough to
eradicate the very realm itself while transforming him permenatly into a
red goliath, Scaling him Moderately enough to surpass Beast gohan.</p>
<p>● Going to the past:</p>
<p>Changed in more than Just his very appearance, he now has means to
traverse the very universe by means of opening rifts at will. Even with
his wish made evident, he was no fool to rush into a quick death. He
remembered friezas hand through his gut and felt his might entirely.. he
was still no match even now. Yet opportunity smiled on Veiss, with the
scientist Fu. He had the means to take Veiss to the Xenoverse of the
very past before Frieza became black frieza. Taking this opportunity
with no hesitation. Wasting no more time in the present, he swiftly
began attacking Key planets who would aide Frieza in the future, Honing
His Villainy, Cruelty and Genocidal tendancies. Even the universe six
Tuffles various technologies for himself as well adopting both Soven and
Jedda to his Cause.</p>
<p>● Currently:</p>
<p>He in his Fortress in space, he Monitors the entirety of the very
universe. Seeking warriors outside the normal to a plan he forged with
his children. He knows where the super dragonballs are located, His own
intense training concluded with Soven now Capable. All that he needs now
is a means to conquer hell itself to claim the sin extractors he learned
from Neva, the time scroll containing his ( and the Casts dark future in
which they escaped ) And lastly a Warrior Capable of controling spirits.
As well in days later... he personaly Killed Bojack and his crew using
his rift to a planet naturally exploiding on its own.</p>
<h2 id="trivia">Trivia</h2>
<p>● Whenever he feels restless in his insomia, he switches all his
monitors over to the still thriving Namek, Just to Gaze the planet and
reflecting on what now feels like a lifetime ago. Perhaps in his way..
this is him addressing his homesickness.</p>
<p>● As a means to hone his Accuracy with placing the rifts he creates,
he'll use his free time to systematically displace Characters in the
saiyan Victorias universe to either stir the drama pot for
entertainment, mess with sweety and her sense of navigation or to
stratigically pair two unlikely to interact.</p>
<p>● Though he is Evil, he is a lawful evil That does Value life Highly.
He practices his beliefs on his fortress, shares only to his children of
his philosophy of what evil means should good be absent.</p>
<p>● He is purchasing a few planets in space for yet another purpose,
fully aware of his problem with chi. With this planets full of life, he
has already made an entire colony of genetically modified Saiba men as
tenacious as first time super saiyans to populate and Guard a Tree of
might also modified to his specifications to restore his energy.
Brilliantly using his experiences as one who use to plant nameks very
tree's to... this hellish world. Due to Jedda having yet to claim a
suitable body of his own, Veiss gave him the responsibility to ready the
mass harvest of Fruits.</p>
<p>● Lastly He is for now, the only Character in the universe more
focused on Techniques than he is of Transformations to rely on, since
his form is permenant and will not revert back even if he dies.</p>
