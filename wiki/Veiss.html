<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Origins">Origins</span></h2>
<p>Years after the cast has escaped this future, Frieza Became the new official God of Destruction by right. For even Beerus himself could not quell the tyrant...
The universe was his and his forever, and he made this very clear to all inhabitants that his now Godly grip was on everyones throats.. even deciding your afterlife.. 
Veiss's life was but that of a humbled Gardner and teacher to his four sons in agriculture as well a enthusiastic story teller of the many perils Namekians had endured from disastrous natures to Saiyan foes of eld whom endangered them time after time only to have been saved by the brave warriors to lul his sons to sleep. Elder Kami slug was now the current ruler of New namek forgoing his once evil ways to take the universe for himself to maintain the peace.. yet the threat of pure calculated evil knows no such rest. Resistence fell swiftly, the ominous winds escaping could not carry them to safety this time.. All were captured within the hour before frieza's arrival, and indeed, their was a hell to pay for.
</p><p><b> Coming of the hellhound </b>
</p>
<ul><li>Enslavement was not new to the namekians who had lived prior to now, but the restlessness was made evident this time that no savior was coming, yet under the orders of Dr. Myuu and his faction of Frieza forces, they would cultivate all of nameks resources every year until their dragonballs had fully recharged. Veiss never knowing shackles before, observed his enemies keenly for any opportunity to exploit or a weakness in their formation to run down. Elder slug reading Veiss easily persists to him to not take their bait.. they would be more than happy to shoot him dead for laughs. Veiss using his sensing felt the truth of slugs wisdom, they were more than enough to slaughter everyone. Days to weeks the many tribes of them began to wither from exhaustion, picking apart once blue fields to utter wastelands for precious minerals, fighting starvation, fatigue, wilter tools overused and even the watchmen who delighted themselves on placing boot to heads before shooting them coldly. Few did fight back with time, including his eldest son Flu on the very day He met... him.</li></ul>
<p>Veiss's head cratered the ground he was pinned, forced to witness frieza himself killing his kind in turns with death beams til he reached flu. Veiss's eyes began to strain to the sight of such cruelty as frieza used Hakai, deleting him entirely.
his loss became a boon as his Warrior instincts awoken, his power rising folds and his captors very leg snaps like a twig, Veiss's rampage was clear.. He wants Justice.
</p><p><b> " Murderer!!! He was my Son!!! " </b>
</p>
<ul><li>Elder Slugs Sinister smile evident as he watched Veiss loss himself to the frenzy, spurring the other Namekians to cheer as Veiss one after the other took the lives of his oppressors, Adapting fast to the self he thought no longer factored. As fast as his actions to defy arose, so to was the reality of overwhelming might to his gutt being impaled by a god. Yet he survived thanks to his remaining sons healing him. He felt the change within his being stir, unfamiliar and yet so liberating. Slugs laughter broke his euphoria, handing him a poach of water. Many lessons were learned for Veiss, he was to new to fighting, yet he had undeniable pain be his teacher. Slug was no longer doubtful of Veiss, making his choice by fusing himself to veiss in order to survive whats to come.</li></ul>
<p><b> Pilgrimage to the demonrealm </b>
</p>
<ul><li>With his remaining sons in two years time, a Darring escape from Namek now a lifeless dessert made it more plausible to sneak past friezas men to the escape pods. With barely a handful of Namekians alive and nearing extinction, they no longer feared death. If it was to end, let it end with even four to find a new home to start again. Rioting loudly with what strengh they had left, did all they can to buy Veiss and his sons the time they needed to get to a usable ship. Even Veiss himself wailed in the assault, reaching closer to the ship of their ideals, Veiss's second son ran ahead to operate it manually. Bodies both Namekian and fearful loyalists piled behind, Veiss's family succeeds as they make haste to go off planet as soon as possible, they all took a last look at Namek through the screens in silence. Only the youngest wept in heavy tears, as they now sailed the cosmos for refuge, had it not been shortly lived. Alarms began blarring with the suddeness of Friezas mothership coming into view, ready to fire at them on the spot. Veiss's body moved on instict, to use himself to shield his children from the coming blast as their very spacecraft becomes obliterated. Veiss in this moment was utterly helpless as his beloved three become dust to him, while he himself was the sturdier to the impact, yet the pain he felt finally unlocked his dormant power to rare for a namekian to have as his first rift swallows him whole before the Vaccume of space could claim him.</li></ul>
<p>He did not begin his Journey on his feet in the demon realm, he latched and crawled himself for hours on end. Broken entirely, Tears finally falling down his cheeks, his Body cindered and wretched with injuries, wounds, and gritting his teeth or force himself to bit his own tongue to find shelter. Twenty malms was his limit before he blackout, yet his very mind refuses to let him dream pleasently for the nightmares have but begun, his once peaceful nature now in conflict to the Violent nurture of Trauma, Grief and despair.. 
</p><p><b> Sparks of a wish </b>
</p>
<ul><li>Veiss finds himself in a demonistic inspired room with unfamiliar maidens changing his very bandages and applying medicines to the burns on his green flesh. Still in a daze with foggy eyes, he is unsure how to speak to them, to tell them to stop mending his body. He knew nothing of these lands, or its customs. No better a stranger in weird envisioned paradise, so many questions swarmed Veiss's thoughts, Vulnerable to his self reflections as he lays confortably in this luxorius room never onced gazed. Struggling to get himself up, he felt the many hands trying to stop him, only to push them all aside for much needed space. Shakily Grabbing the large flower vase of water to drink, he gazed outside the balcony to gain a wider perspective. Spitting out the fungus flower in his mouth, his accute hearing picks up those approuching, the maids pouting, leave like the flock of sirens that they were greet another. The oldest Namekian in native tongue welcomes Veiss to the Kings Capital of the realm. Veiss never knew of Neva, but knew enough that some namekians never returned to namek after the first disaster. The two shook hands, as both began a swift friendship that span for many years with Veiss explaining the current crisis, and Neva teaching the still young Namekian of their original home where only here does frieza's influence ends but struggles remaining the sight to behold.</li></ul>
<p>Neva however was greatly saddened by the loss of their people once more to turmoil outside their control, so much so he gathered his three guardians holding the demon realms very dragonballs that he made so long ago, making this a special case to aide Veiss and encourage him to restore his people and namek. to Veiss.. wishing felt wrong now, for even if he did make such a wish they would only be killed again or worse. Before he could give solid reason, the dragons appearance came and darkened the skies above, his arrival both mystical, majestic and a sense of unbriddled power before his very eyes, as if for once he is seeing himself in his eyes looking back. Stepping forward to the collosal dragon before him without a shred of fear, in his native tongue, Veiss screams out his wish.. to finally unleash all of his latent potential. For this particular dragon to hear a warriors Call for power, it was all to eager to fullfil his wish. As its entirety dances to sky readying itself to disburst, it flung itself forward as well its three dragonballs merging into Veiss as well itself, Veiss finds himself engulfed once more, but this time now, he felt his true self, the sleeping warrior become a Cataclysm of a universe ready to bend to his will, Transforming the super Namekian into a Titan. The waves of power oblitterated all of the demon realm in a blinding flash, with nothing surviving it. His first steps made the grounds quake, His chi now his Warcry, His purpose renewed as what was once kept away from him his whole life was now his truly.
</p><p><b> " I... am sorry Neva, but peace was the first lesson I had to unlearn, the rest I paid for was with great pains to stand here now. " </b>
</p><p><b> Embodiment of all he Hates </b>
</p>
<ul><li>His Body wasn't the only pernament change made by his wish, his mind now as sharp as his coil covered nails and his spirit fortified by his relentless will. Even feeling the very space itself felt more natural, like all it takes for him was a simple as stepping forward to where he wants to go. Gazing upon his cuffs still on his wrists, he quickly collected himself to remind himself of the terrible set backs that transpired, harsh lessons and adopting needed cruelty. Shifting his focus to the now destroyed castle in as well the once surrounding lands now lifeless, he removes the broken debree easily with his rifts aside to find what Neva spoke of throughout his time, Gomah's secret vault. Prying the metal doors open was but a after thought, as he walks forward into the darkness down, Veiss tore off his raggish shirt off of himself to find a unique treasure only given to lords of the past. Raiding the many treasures he founded since he already killed the realm with his wish, he began to experiment with his space abilities. Using the royal baggage that was among a pile of shiny gemstones, he converted the bag into that of a small pocket dimension that only he can fully utilize, and began his practices their in the Vault filled with Gomah's many riches. Only stopping for when he spots his Iconic white coat. Hardly carring for the glass casing surrounding it, putting it on was his way of saying to himself that when he goes bad, I may as well have a bit of fun doing it from time to time.</li></ul>
<p>Before he began the climb upstairs, he found himself scratching at his cuffs, as if it began to irratate him, his memories flood his thoughts like a crashing tsunami. His sons... his people.. both elder Slug and Neva who gave him this one and only chance.. but his worse forbodding living just as freely in his head... Frieza.. causing Veiss to feel his chest tighten, his fist clenching so hard they bleed, his contorting face filling with malice as his laugh echoes.
</p><p><b> " If I'm to kill him.. I cannot do it now, simply overpowering him is tedius. No.. I must practice his methods for myself, if I'm to understand that monster, I must adopt his cruelty.. " </b>

<ul><li>still unsure of many things, he finds the tuffle planet that made peace with the saiyans of universe six, Basking in the wonders he never could have imagined since he travels between spaces. It was here he stayed for a year to educate himself on the Zuno program, hilariously being scolded by a hologram in high definition. Valuing all he came across, he visited the agroculture labs to steal seeds as well three trees of mights to solve a recurring problem he's been having. But his greatest finds were the tuffle twins... Both Soven and Jedda who looked to him now as their father. Much like a genocidal bandit with precious loot, he steals a space fortress for himself to take with him to space and blows up that planet entirely, his only reason was the smartass hologram. ●</li></ul>

</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Powers_and_Abilities">Powers and Abilities</span></h3>
<p>• Bending space at will. = His most notible Ability with heavy applications to how Veiss can use this to traverse freely in the Universe. Even in battle he can redirect both physical and chi based attacks back to their senders. 
</p><p>• Namekian Anatomy = as a Namekian or should the very last of his Kind. He in nature already had

                             Hearing
               ○ Telepathy: rarely used by Veiss personally, but should a situation require cordination or a direct plan, he'll voice to whoever allows him to.
               ○ Arm Extention: Strechy arms.
</pre>
<p>● Shadow Crusher = his main counter to ki blasters by phasing into the beam current to Strike at the users with full force to hit them insanely Hard.
</p><p>● Evil Blast = His Ace in his Arsonal of attacks by bending space on himself to leave behind his Image to fool his opponents into a cunning trap, then Blasting them with as much Darkness to either stun, incapacitate or... Rarely kill should it become necessary.
</p><p>● Last emperor = All he has ever learned from Black frieza during his time as a slave as well the festering hatred and resent of his experiences has accumulated his Ultimate attack that Turns all of his Ability to bend space into one Ki free Beam Towards his foe with everything he has, either at point blank or far, this attack is painful.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Weaknesses">Weaknesses</span></h2>
<p>● Whistling... = Due to namekians sense of hearing being a hundred folds more potent, the sharp sound is to a Namekian, the equivalent of a million pins dropping all at once.
</p><p>● Chi Exhaustion = Despite having a near universal ocean of Chi to use to open rifts to bend space, it takes Quite a bit of power from him to either maintain or even Stabilize rifts if his focus is for a moment misplaced. Anything Much larger for transport like relocating a planet forces Veiss to remain absolutely still while moving said object safely.
</p><p>● His inability to revert back to a normal Namekian warrior. = Since he made his wish in the demon realm to unleash all of his Latent power and in the process Destroying the future realm in Transition thanks to the demon Dragon merging itself to Veiss. He cannot fully Maintain long running Battles due to the power coat he exudes. This dangerous for him for the simple fact that he hasn't adjusted to this body. He hasn't discovered this weakness yet.

<p>● Elder Kami Slug
</p>
<ul><li>Last of the Elders of Namek and even before then, A once feared Conquerer of the western quadrant, or once was until his Major defeat to Goku and his Allies forced the super namekian away from earth, returned changed to enjoy his remaining days... Yet once Frieza's Army had completly and hilariously enslaved the entire race, he sought out for even one Namekian warrior to take the stand as well... fuse with said Namekian to pass on all of his Evil Nature as his inheritance, to teach in secret. Veiss was infact that student for his days of fighting has long since left him entirely. Since then he has remained silent within Veiss but feeds the evil he harbors while enjoying the battles in his eyes.</li></ul>
<p>● Neva, Scholar of the demon realm.
</p>
<ul><li>Oldest Namekian elder to have ever lived, he remained behind when his people sought for thwir liberation outside. Only to then be told that a Namekian has returned spur life to the elders legs to see a barely alive veiss tended to by the royal Maids of lord Gomah. Once Veiss explained that All there people have met extinction and Namek uninhabbitable.. Neva's gentle heart Shattered, for he gave up everything to save his people.. only to outlive them all. No longer feeling compelled to serve the demon realm or its vile ruler, Neva summons the taigomi with the demon realms Dragonballs for one final Sacrifice.. with just enough Magic still within his veins, he disabled the Guardians to allow Veiss to make the last wish... to hear his peoples warcry, his raw emotion in their native tongue to have all his Latent power be granted, Brought a smile to Neva before excepting the very end of himself as well the realm he served for eons... rest well neva, your finally with them.</li></ul>
<p>● Soven and Jedda
</p>
<ul><li>Tuffle twins in the prototype phase. Veiss spent much time here to learn many things of the ever expanding universe. These two weren't even concious of yet of the world and yet even in their developmental state. They felt Veiss, his power, his struggles, his mind fortifying on knowledge he never knew. To them both in unison, they have called him Father. Upon openong their young eyes to finally see the world, their fist sight was indeed Veiss Carrying them both in his Arms as he laid waste to the tuffle world with his simple eye beams, his rifts Dropping meteors from the skies and Stealing The tuffle fortress where they call home.</li></ul>
<p>● Soven is a shy and timid child and follower of Veiss. To him, Veiss is a Hero, even if others disagree with his methods.
</p><p>● Jedda Is the collective and bold tuffle child who learns as much from their adoptive Father. He Knows that once he and soven find a host either dead or alive, they would finally begin their operation into full swing.
</p><p>● Sweety
</p>
<ul><li>His very first Attempt to take the timescroll that contained his and the casts very history, ended with him Against Sweety, Pumpikon and Gubber in a fight he would have easily won with the crippled Gubber beneath his foot, Pumpikon fighting off Cell max that he opened a rift for to deal with the brash Saiyan woman and sweety. Yet he completly underestimated Just how power she can truly be when she fights without her Limits in check. In the end of this confrontation, no one really won here. Gubber retires, Pumpikon Selflessly Dies to stop cell Max and sweety weeps. Yet Veiss retrieves Pumpikons corpse for soven to take host of, all her power, her memories and perhaps her spirit now trapped in the dense layers of systems.</li></ul>
<p>● Wargirl: Has yet to encounter her in any related stories.... Yet
</p><p>● Victoria Black:
</p>
<ul><li>They have not met officially but after much time in his recovery as well sparrings with soven Now Pumpikon. He is even more powerful now but much more cautious this time patrollers like sweety, doing a thorough search for any real threats to himself. His eyes catching victoria Black in secret calls upon the tufflized saiyan to observe and report everything pertaining.</li></ul>
<p>● Vanessa: Has yet to encounter her in any related stories... yet
</p><p>● Harmony: Has yet to encounter her in any related stories... yet
</p><p>●Binary: Has yet to encounter her in any related stories... yet. 
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Notable_Moments">Notable Moments</span></h2>
<p>● Surviving Impalement by black frieza himself, all the while Fighting back against far stronger opponents and killing them to Avenge his son.. who was tragically erased by Frieza's Hakai.
</p><p>● Leading the last tribe of living Namekians remaining on a now lifeless Namek to Escape.
Veiss first success in displaying his tactics only to have frieza's mothership Firing their main Cannon.. obliterating the very ship, as well his remaining sons
</p><p>● His first rift created in the midst of his life ending, bending Space just enough to escape Death. Yet as he Crawled across the demon realm on his belly due to the severity of the numerous injurys, he still had enough will power to Keep going.
</p><p>● His Wish:
</p>
<ul><li>Befriending Neva of the demon realm, Veiss told his Tale, spent a decade their to learn, recover, Train Himself to hone his battle instincts enough to defend himself.</li></ul>
<p>Yet by Nevas own Actions, he called the taigomi to a remote location to disable them to use the Demon realms Dragonballs for one last time. Although Veiss was already a super namekian at this point in his life, he in his peoples Tongue made his warcry know within his wish to Avenge his people, to Unlock all of his latent potential power for the fight to come. A easy wish for the dragon sure.. but after hearing a Young warriors need for power the Demon dragon as well the three dragonballs become one with Veiss in a display of unimaginable power, enough to eradicate the very realm itself while transforming him permenatly into a red goliath, Scaling him Moderately enough to surpass Beast gohan.
</p><p>● Going to the past:
</p><p>Changed in more than Just his very appearance, he now has means to traverse the very universe by means of opening rifts at will. Even with his wish made evident, he was no fool to rush into a quick death. He remembered friezas hand through his gut and felt his might entirely.. he was still no match even now. Yet opportunity smiled on Veiss, with the scientist Fu. He had the means to take Veiss to the Xenoverse of the very past before Frieza became black frieza. Taking this opportunity with no hesitation.
Wasting no more time in the present, he swiftly began attacking Key planets who would aide Frieza in the future, Honing His Villainy, Cruelty and Genocidal tendancies.
Even the universe six Tuffles various technologies for himself as well adopting both Soven and Jedda to his Cause.

<p>● Knowing all that he has, as well the lessons learned from Black frieza of the doomed future... it was as easy to him to establish his path of universal Dominance Across Sweety's reality. Establishing the tuffle races utilizations to control the saiyan races as well others. Imbreading a new Army of Saibamen as well the trees of might.. and Slaying opposition who would go against him, such as the fate of Bojack, Pumpikon and even the tuffles who rebelled against him... Taking their Fortress for himself as well the highly advanced tuffle twins of both Soven and Jedda to his Cause.
Yet only one remained, for sweety herself was to much a wildcard to ignore. His patients has awarded him as his power expanded to a terrifying level... almost close to his oppressor in the future, but his recent discovery that his power of space can unabattedly reach into the other sets of universes of Drakor and Victoria's reality, he quickly surmised that he was more Vulnerable in their realities then he is in Sweety's. Using the availability of his Tuffles technology in a swarm of microscoptic camera drones, he can safely observe the events unfolding in the other realities without revealing himself as he Gathers all resources.

<p>● Using his rifts to disorient Sweety across the board, he orders super 17 to neutralize Sweety as a perfect counter measure to contain her spontanious powers.. not to kill her, but be the container to keep her incheck on a world of Veiss's choosings. The rest was like a reanactment of how Frieza took over in Sweety's universe, he was Primordial. Even going as far to lay waste to conton city itself to claim the scroll containing both his ( and the casts ) Dark future. Using it as a instruction manual to become the figure black frieza himself would achieve for himself as its tyrant. Yet Hope remains.. for a rift remains open naturally to sweety's own universe now in Veiss's control.. whose to say what else Veiss has instore for the other universes...

<p>● Whenever he feels restless in his insomia, he switches all his monitors over to the still thriving Namek, Just to Gaze the planet and reflecting on what now feels like a lifetime ago. Perhaps in his way.. this is him addressing his homesickness.
</p><p>● As a means to hone his Accuracy with placing the rifts he creates, he'll use his free time to systematically displace Characters in the saiyan Victorias universe to either stir the drama pot for entertainment, mess with sweety and her sense of navigation or to stratigically pair two unlikely to interact.
</p><p>● Though he is Evil,  he is a lawful evil That does Value life Highly. He practices his beliefs on his fortress, shares only to his children of his philosophy of what evil means should good be absent.
</p><p>● He is purchasing a few planets in space for yet another purpose, fully aware of his problem with chi. With this planets full of life, he has already made an entire colony of genetically modified Saiba men as tenacious as first time super saiyans to populate and Guard a Tree of might also modified to his specifications to restore his energy. Brilliantly using his experiences as one who use to plant nameks very tree's to... this hellish world. Due to Jedda having yet to claim a suitable body of his own, Veiss gave him the responsibility to ready the mass harvest of Fruits.
</p><p>● Lastly He is for now, the only Character in the universe more focused on Techniques than he is of Transformations to rely on, since his form is permenant and will not revert back even if he dies.
